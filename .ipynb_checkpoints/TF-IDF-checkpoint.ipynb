The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, \"Waltz For Venus\". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda\\'s) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an \"accident\"). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly \"died\". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike\\'s gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves \"too slow\". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike\\'s part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike\\'s fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye \"only sees the present\" and his left eye \"only sees the past.\" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or \"No Smoking\" signs.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Faye Valentine\\nBirthday: August 14, 1994\\n\\nOne of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.\\n\\nSeemingly little more than a thorn in her partners’ sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in \"Cowboy Funk\") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.\\n\\n\\nThroughout the series, though she retains her sarcastic demeanor and unpleasant nature up until the very end, it is easy to see her grow as a character. She learns to value her comrades, coming back to the Bebop when she realizes that it is the only home that she has left, naming it as the “only place I could return to”. She grows to understand the disadvantages of being a loner, and that even though her \"family\" is somewhat dysfunctional it is still a place where she will always belong.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Jet, known on his home satellite as the \"Black Dog\" for his tenacity, is a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede (a Jovian satellite) and acts as Spike\\'s foil during the series. Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or \"dad\" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old).\\n\\nJet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede\\'s surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet \"customized\" with larger engines).\\n\\nDuring the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa\\'s new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.'}},\n",

He is a fairly tall, and lean-built person with peach skin and brown eyes. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears standard Shinigami attire with the addition of a strap across his chest.\\n\\nWhen he was young, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world. Ichigo always smiled whenever he was with Masaki and he was regularly at her side, holding her hand.\\n\\nAs a teenager, Ichigo\\'s personality is much more complex. Stubborn, short-tempered, occasionally confrontational, determined, outspoken, strong-willed and impulsive, he attempts to maintain a detached and \"cool\" image, despite claiming to not care about what other people think about him. He generally keeps his face set in a permanent scowl with his eyebrows drawn together. Ichigo carries the burden of the real world and the spirit world (Soul Society), a task quite difficult, especially for a teenager like Ichigo, who has his own worries and problems. Also, Ichigo is quite smart; he was ranked 23rd in his high school. He does this partly to prove to his teachers and classmates that just because he\\'s unique, or somewhat punkish, that he can still succeed.\\n\\nWhen Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakutō is a standard-looking katana, but oversized with an equally-oversized brown sheathe hung by a strap over his right shoulder. It has a rectangular bronze hand guard with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short ones. The handle is red with two light blue tassels on the end of the handle. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo\\'s spiritual power, which he didn\\'t know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It was even able to upturn the ground with a single strike. Because of its weak spiritual energy nature, Byakuya Kuchiki was able to easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo and Kisuke Urahara subsequently slices it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakutō in order to release its true form. This sword is found to be a result of Rukia\\'s deprived spiritual energy and not a result of his own power.'}},\n",

She does not remove her hairpins, except to sleep (she is seen without them in episode 64 when she wakes up), as they are worn in memory of her brother, while her hair is worn long in honor of the promise Tatsuki Arisawa once made to protect her. Her large breasts are occasionally made the subject of jokes in the series. She also has an amazingly hard head, which has injured Uryū, Chad, and Ichigo. The only person who has been able to damage her head has been Yachiru Kusajishi in a comical moment when she is riding on Kenpachi Zaraki\\'s shoulders. Orihime has yellow-orange/brown eyes in colored pictures of the manga, but gray eyes in the anime.\\n\\nOrihime is friendly, humorous in her own way, sensitive, and kind. She comes off as naive and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school. Apparently, she is hopeless when it comes to technology. One of the members of the Handicrafts\\' Club remarks that she is not smart enough to use a cell phone, which is why she does not have one. Additionally, according to Tatsuki, Orihime has the fighting skill of a black belt, however, in the English dubbed version she says Orihime is at the skill of a yellow belt.\\n\\nOrihime cooks and eats strange food at home, although she also likes some normal food. Aside from Rangiku Matsumoto and possibly Tessai Tsukabishi, no one shares Orihime\\'s tastes. Her favorite food is red bean paste, and she likes putting butter on sweet potatoes.\\n\\nOrihime has a tendency to rush into situations without thinking, sometimes leading to embarrassing consequences. At one point, the schoolgirls ask Rukia if she has feelings for Ichigo. When Rukia denies any such thing, Orihime is disappointed that Rukia does not share her sentiments, because if she had, then it would be two girls against one boy and therefore the girls \"team\" would win, which makes no sense. She also tends to have an overactive imagination and gets carried away thinking of implausible scenarios, such as portraying herself as a futuristic and apparently highly destructive robot in an assignment asking \"How do you see yourself in the future?\", when the question refers to what occupation one wishes or believes they will have.\\n\\nOrihime has also demonstrated that she is perceptive, mostly when it comes to Ichigo Kurosaki. She is in love with Ichigo, and in both the manga and anime, her feelings only become more evident as time goes on. She has revealed these feelings both to Rangiku Matsumoto and to Ichigo himself, though he was asleep at the time. She also has the uncanny ability to detect Ichigo by scent and sense his spiritual pressure, even when masked by the visored.\\n\\nOrihime lives by herself in Karakura Town, where the story takes place, and is supported by relatives living elsewhere. Previously, she had lived with her older brother, Sora, who was fifteen years older than her. She and her brother were raised by a drunk father and an unfaithful mother, who always argued and beat their children. It is unknown if her parents are still alive.\\n\\nWhen Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her since. For six years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her long hair. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. On the same day, Sora was wounded in a car accident and died in the Kurosaki clinic. Orihime has worn the hairpins ever since. A year after Sora died, Orihime met Tatsuki who defended her from the bullies. They have been best friends ever since.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Age: 15-16 (series), 18 (movie, end of the series)\\nBirthday: 1899\\nBirthplace: Resembool, Amestris\\nFamily: Alphonse Elric (brother), Trisha Elric (mother, deceased), Van Hohenheim (father)\\nAffiliations: State Military\\nWinry Rockbell\\nPinako Rockbell\\nIzumi Curtis (teacher)\\nRoy Mustang (Commander)\\nSpecies: Human\\nOccupation: State Alchemist\\nAbilities: Alchemy, Martial Arts\\nWeapon: Alchemy, Automail arm and leg\\n\\nEdward \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" Elric is a young alchemical prodigy. He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed\\'s primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn\\'t seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al\\'s suffering.\\n\\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4\\'11\"), however, his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed\\'s ability to fight is not impaired and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\\n\\nBorn to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward\\'s first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad\\'s formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dead mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\\n\\nEdward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi\\'s intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. \\n\\nThough instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the \"One is All, All is One\" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics of a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.\\n\\nDevising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.\\n\\nAlphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God\\'s domain and peeking at the Gate\\'s vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al\\'s soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy\\'s life.\\n\\nOn the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbell\\'s in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother\\'s body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automail at age 11 when it took most adults three years.'}},\n",

With his parents and family now gone, his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.\\n\\nAfter his fight with Naruto, he believes he\\'s been wasting his time \"playing ninja\" with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing Itachi and then restore the Uchiha clan.\\n\\nAs a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.\\n\\nClaiming at first that he doesn\\'t need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. Sasuke openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.\\n\\nAppearance\\nSasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.\\n\\nAt the beginning of Part I, Sasuke\\'s clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.\\n\\nIn Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that\\'s open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. He also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in Curse Seal Level 2 room to move (also without transforming).'}},\n",

He lives with his mother, Hiroko Makunouchi, and helps with the family charter boat fishing business. Ippo is a classic power in-boxer and is well known for his Peek-a-Boo style of boxing and hard punches which include three signature punches: a rib-cracking liver blow, Gazelle punch (an uppercut variant), and the Dempsey roll technique. His signature punches appear to be modelled after Mike Tyson, Floyd Patterson and Jack Dempsey respectively.\\n\\nIppo is bullied throughout most of his school life. After being rescued by Takamura, he ends up being brought to Kamogawa Gym, where he displays an explosive punching power. After seeing a video of Mike Tyson, he becomes inspired to take up boxing to feel reborn with strength. He soon proves himself to Takamura and Kamogawa, and starts on the path to being a pro boxer.\\n\\nHis Pro-Debut Match was against Oda Yusuke, He was largely regarded as a lazy and unmotivated boxer, but when his girlfriend threatened to break up with him, he committed himself to training. From the first time the boxers met, there was tension between them, as a misunderstanding led Oda to believe Ippo made fun of him. On the actual fight, Ippo seemed to have the advantage from the beginning of the match, but was saved by his coach from losing the fight due to a cut. Ippo managed a comeback by knocking Oda out with a series of jabs, thus winning the fight.'}},\n",

With his unruly hair (He\\'s often called \"Urchin Head\") and sunglasses, people already judge him poorly (It doesn\\'t help that he gives unflattering nicknames to almost anyone he meets, e.g. \"monkey trainer\" Shido and \"thread spool\" Kazuki). But he is actually a great guy with a strong sense of leadership and a very talented person. He is one quarter German and he\\'s the grandchild of the \"Last Witch of the 20th Century\".\\n\\nHe\\'s also a brother-like figure to Kudou Himiko after she has gotten over her brother\\'s death. Himiko\\'s average fighting skills meant that she often bites off more than what she can chew. In such situations, Ban can be counted on to come to her aid (though it must be noted that she does return the favor at times).\\n\\nIn the GB duo, he\\'s often the one who thinks of plans for their moves. Initially, Ginji was seen to be a sidekick to him. (In fact, when they first formed their partnership, Ban insisted that Ginji was only his sidekick.) As the story progresses, Ginji gradually held his own in their missions, and Ban acknowledged him as an equal.\\n\\nBan is feared due to his procession of the Jagan, a power which allows him to make anyone he makes eye contact with to watch a one minute long illusion, however, it should only be used three times per day. The Evil Eye cannot be used on the same person again for the next 24 hours. Furthermore, while the illusion only lasts for one minute, should Ban will it, the one affected by the Jagan can be placed inside a time-warp zone via the illusion created by the technique, meaning that to them, one minute in real life could last up to several hours in the Jagan\\'s influence. \\n\\nBecause he is a direct descendant of the Witch clan, and being born under the star of Asclepius, he possesses incredible superhuman strength, which gives him a gripping force of 200 kgf (2 kN) in each hand. It is also shown that he is strong enough break open the doors of an armored steel truck and punch hard enough to create large craters in the ground or break walls; occasionally even collapsing multi-storied buildings.\\n\\nAt full power, his right hand becomes a snake\\'s claw that can crush anything. Also, while powering up, the astral outline of a giant snake can be seen surrounding him. The general impression of people when taking their first look at him is of a skinny or ordinary person; however, a close look will reveal that he is of a fair height and has solid shoulders and large, muscular and solid arms. His unruly ordinary appearance often deceive enemies and they don\\'t expect his level of superhuman super strength.'}},\n",

She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world, and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool.

Using special gloves that create a spark when he snaps his fingers, Roy can create anything from a tiny ember to burn a letter, to a raging inferno that can destroy a humanoid body in seconds. His precise control over the alchemically enhanced flame is so accurate that he can boil the water in a persons\\' eyes and can also attack enemies amongst a riot without hurting any allies.\\n\\nOutwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and almost always one step ahead of his opponents, and likes to feel in control of the situation. He is one of the superiors of Edward Elric. On the surface, he appears to be nothing more than a man of the military who pursues promotions and praise and is considered a ladies\\' man who constantly goes on dates with different women. Mustang\\'s true goal is to become Führer in order to gain the power to reform the government in order to absolve his sins in the Ishval War as well as change the country for the better, along with the joking requirement for female officers to wear tiny miniskirts (which considerably increased Havoc\\'s loyalty to him and caused Hawkeye to be angry with him).\\n\\nHis goals are admirable enough that he earns the fierce loyalty of his good friends Lt Col. Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, and his own subordinates, among whom are Riza Hawkeye, Jean Havoc, Heymans Breda, Vato Falman, and Kain Fuery. While Mustang has a close and amicable relationship with all of his subordinates, he appears to share a deeper bond of affection with his second-in-command Riza Hawkeye, who has devoted her life to supporting him. This bond culminates in the final episodes of the anime when Mustang chooses Hawkeye alone to accompany him on his greatest and most dangerous mission.\\n\\nThough a hero of the Ishval War, he remains haunted by the horrors of war and suffers great remorse for the lives he took.\\n\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

She also doubles as his voice of reason, keeping cool in heated situations and scolding him when he allows his emotions to get in the way. Riza and Roy seem to share a close relationship in both adaptations of Fullmetal Alchemist; in the anime she identifies him as her most precious person, whereas in the manga she loses her resolve to live when believing he has been killed. Riza specializes in firearms, particularly sniper rifles, and can hit nearly any target with lethal accuracy. She adopts a dog, called Black Hayate in both the anime and the manga, which she raises with stern discipline; when Hayate goes to the bathroom inside, she shoots at the wall behind him to reinforce that doing so is bad.\"}},\n",

Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and Kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. Given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on Guy\\'s part. Nevertheless, Guy is proud of his record.\\n\\nThough he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"Icha Icha Paradise\" (イチャイチャパラダイス, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally \"Make Out Paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (イチャイチャバイオレンス, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally \"Make Out Violence\"). In Part II Naruto gives him the new \"Icha Icha Tactics\" (イチャイチャタクティクス, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally \"Make Out Tactics\").\\n\\nKakashi\\'s Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent\\'s movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi\\'s use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. In Part II Kakashi is able to develop his own Mangekyo Sharingan. With his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another\\'s arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. Much like the standard Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan tires Kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.\\n\\nWith his Sharingan Kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\". As a result, Kakashi\\'s arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. Many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. He does, however, use Water Release: Water Encampment Wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. He less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique to attack opponents or Earth Release: Inner Decapitation Technique (土遁・心中斬首の術, Doton: Shinjū Zanshu no Jutsu, Viz \"Groundhog Technique Decapitation\", English TV \"Headhunter Jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. He can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks Naruto\\'s chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.\\n\\nWhile Kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his Sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique (魔幻・奈烙見の術, Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. A Thousand Years of Pain (death in english dub) (千年殺し, Sennen Goroshi) consists of Kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent\\'s rectum. While only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.\\n\\nWhen he was younger, Kakashi was taught how to use the Rasengan by the Fourth Hokage. Because the Rasengan is meant to have the user\\'s chakra nature mixed with it, Kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In time he instead created the Chidori, his only original jutsu. After the jutsu\\'s initial creation, Kakashi was unable to use the Chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. After acquiring the Sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. Through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, Kakashi\\'s Chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the Lightning Blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it.'}},\n",

At first, he thinks that Go is just for oldsters and he is annoyed at Sai\\'s demand to play, but little by little his passion for Go increases as he plays more and more. From being a member of a school Go club to being an insei and finally becoming a professional Go player (at 14 years old) a year after Akira, Hikaru matures throughout the course of the series. Throughout the series, Hikaru gradually gets taller because the manga volumes are around when he is getting older and playing Go at the same time. Hikaru is often portrayed wearing clothing having the numeral \"5\". This is a pun on the Japanese common name for five: go. His birthday is September 20th. Part of his strength is his ability to read far into the game very fast, and to make seemingly stupid moves. These moves in fact lure the opponent to doing stupid moves, which Hikaru then traps them by.'}},\n",

       "   'about': \"Birthday: November 2\\n\\nYet another insei in the same group as Hikaru, Ochi is one of the youngest (12 years old when introduced), yet very outspoken about his ability. His bragging about his strength hides his insecurity; after each loss he is known to disappear into the restroom for long periods of time. Akira tutors him to find out about Hikaru's current strength. Ochi is unnerved by Hikaru because Akira's obsession about him seems to suggest there is more to Hikaru than what Ochi knows. Ochi is also angry that Akira acknowledges Hikaru as a rival, but not Ochi himself. He demands that Akira view him as a rival if he can defeat Hikaru in the pro exam. Ochi loses to Hikaru, but does pass the pro exam. He comes from a wealthy family, as evidenced by the number of pros that come to his household to tutor him privately in go.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)\"}},\n",

       "   'about': \"A Go professional 9-dan and student of Touya Kouyo. He first took notice of Hikaru when the latter explained a go move during a children's tournament that even professional Go players would take some time to see (which was actually Sai's doing) and later, as the rivalry between Hikaru and Akira emerged, catalyzed its development for several times, such as helping Hikaru to be accepted into the Insei test and occasionally reporting Hikaru's progress to an uninterested and disillusioned Akira. After the Net game between Touya Kouyo and Sai, Ogata also became obsessed with playing Sai and constantly nagged Hikaru. Unbeknownst to him, his request was finally granted just before Sai disappeared, during a game with Hikaru when he was too drunk to notice Sai was playing.\\n\\nOgata is one of the best young Go pros of Japan, having been the challenger for many titles throughout the series and finally winning the Gosei and Judan titles when Touya Kouyo retires. He's frequently after the Honinbo title Kuwabara currently holds and this sparks a rivalry between them. His birthday is January 17th.\"}},\n",

He was abandoned by his biological parents because of the supposed \"deformity\" of his left arm (which was later revealed to be caused by his Innocence). He was eventually found and adopted by a traveling performer named Mana Walker on Christmas Day. Some time later Mana died, and Allen, tormented with grief and manipulated by the Millennium Earl, turned Mana into an Akuma, hoping that his beloved surrogate father would be fully resurrected. But the Mana Akuma cursed Allen and sliced through his left eye, leaving the \"Pentacle\" — the mark of the Akuma — which scars the left side of his face. This enabled his left eye to see the souls trapped within the Akuma from then on. It was at this same moment that Allen\\'s left arm first invoked as an Anti-Akuma weapon, which instinctively destroyed the Mana Akuma. During the course of this traumatic event, Allen\\'s hair turned from brown into a stark white.\\n\\nAllen eventually meets Cross Marian, a General of the Black Order, who explained to Allen the ways of the Akuma and the trapped souls within them: Once a soul becomes trapped inside an Akuma, they are trapped forever; and that the only way to save one is to exorcise them from their Akuma vessel. Allen subsequently became Cross\\' disciple and spent the next three years with him before being sent to the Black Order to become an official exorcist. During this time, Allen was tormented by his master\\'s constant irresponsible behavior and forced into various odd-jobs to pay off the debts that General Cross accumulated. This, coupled with Marian\\'s womanizing ways and harsh treatment towards Allen, led to Walker fearing more than respecting his master whom he never speaks fondly of. \\n\\nAbilities\\n\\nIn addition to being physically fit and skilled at combat (as evident by his ability to fight and dodge Fou without the use of his Innocence), Allen has a few odd talents and skills. Because of the many debts Allen was forced into paying by Cross, he learned to play cards and gamble at a very young age, though his initial purpose was to practice his numb deformed left hand. He also learned how to cheat and win through deception and doesn\\'t hesitate to use these tactics whenever necessary. In fact, he is quite proud of his talents. This is a stark contrast to his polite and courteous nature and often surprises his friends who wouldn\\'t expect such a dark side to Allen and has caused them to wonder just what Cross has done to him. Walker also possesses circus abilities such as juggling and acrobatics, which he learned from traveling with Mana who was himself a circus clown by trade.\\n\\nAllen\\'s synchronization ratio reached a maximum of 83% before having his Innocence destroyed  Yet unknown to Allen, the Innocence lingered around as a hazy fog of particles; at the time, a direct reflection of his shattered state of mind. It wasn\\'t until he came to an epiphany that he was able to seize control of his Anti-Akuma weapon once again and achieving his Innocence\\'s true, fully-invoked form. When not activated, his arm is black and meets with his shoulder in a spiraling pattern that ends with tattoo-like emblem. Following this, the Order gave it the official designation of Crowned Clown (神ノ道化（クラウン・クラウン）, Kuraun Kuraun), due to its jester-like appearance when invoked. The kanji used in the name literally translates to God\\'s Clown (神ノ道化, Kami no Douke).\\n\\nWhen invoked, Crowned Clown acts as a body-armored Innocence, forming a white-hooded cowl and sleeve of Innocence energy which covers his shoulders and right arm, while his left arm and hand become slender and black, clad in armor and razor sharp claws. A masquerade-style mask is always affixed to the cowl, which takes on various configurations and appearances. This transformation also changes Allen\\'s usual hairstyle from flat to a spiky rear. As before, his Innocence possesses a certain degree of sentience, but as Crowned Crown is able to manipulate Allen\\'s entire body like a marionette when incapacitated, or simply assisting in evasive tactics.\\n\\nWhen facing Tyki yet again, Allen synchronization with his Innocence exceeded 100% which activated his new Crowned Crown ability, Sword of Exorcism. The Sword of Exorcism has the ability to exorcist an Akuma on touch and even the ability to exorcist the Noah Gene from Noah\\'s themselves. What shocked Tyki the most wasn\\'t the ability of the sword but rather the similarity between Allen\\'s Sword of Exorcism and the Millennium Earl\\'s sword.\\n\\nStory\\n\\nInspector Levrier and Cross have both referred to a \"player\" (as in one who plays a musical instrument), and Cross has hinted that there may be more than one.'}},\n",

His original name was Shinta (心太).  His parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon.  Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and were about to kill him when a man named Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning \"Heart of Sword,\" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.\\n\\n\\nThe next time Kenshin is seen is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes.  Those long 10 years have taken him from Kyoto, all over Japan to where we find him in episode one of the anime, in Tokyo, still keeping his vow never to kill again.  It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again. (See Rurouni Kenshin anime).  \\n\\nKenshin is usually depicted as a care-free swordsman who is very aloof and tends to be a bit simple-minded when it comes to living normally.  He is seen to be doing many of the chores around the dojo that he stays at with Kaoru, (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.).  He believes it is his way of repaying Kaoru with allowing him to stay at her dojo. (although it seems he has gotten attracted to kaoru in the end).\\n\\nHowever, his swordsmanship ranks among the elite as he is seen defeating every rival (with the exception of Hajime Saitou which ended in a draw).  His battle senses are top-notch and he recognizes even the slightest of advantages, strategies and tactics during a sword battle.  \\n\\n(Source: Kenshin Wikia)'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Age: 19\\n\\nSagara Sanosuke left home at an early age to join the Sekihō Army (Sekihō-tai), leaving behind his father (Kamishimoemon), his mother (Naname), and his younger sister (Uki) who adored him. He would return home years later to discover that his mother was dead, having died a couple of years after the birth of his younger brother, Ota, who immediately began to admire Sanosuke for his bravery and boldness. Sanosuke would also find out that his family name was now Higashidani, although he would never use it himself. His sister, after Sanosuke\\'s disappearance and then her mother\\'s death, became overprotective of her younger brother and father, who worked as a local merchant and farmer with the infamy of being a local fighter. Ota, after Sanosuke leaves his family again, would eventually follow his brother\\'s advice and train at the Kamiya Kasshin-Ryū style dojo to become strong.\\n\\nThe Sekihoutai fought for the imperial alliance at the end of the Tokugawa regime and Sanosuke admired his captain, Sagara Sōzō and took the family name Sagara from him. The Sekihō Army were on assignment to spread word of the halving of taxes proclaimed by the revolution. However, when the revolutionary government encountered financial problems, they labeled the Sekihoutai as frauds to bury their promises. This setup was engineered by Shindō Tatewaki, a former officer in the imperial alliance. The Sekihoutai were designated scapegoats and to be executed; Sanosuke was the only survivor, other than his friend Tsukioka Katsuhiro. The exact circumstances of Sōzō\\'s death differ between the animated version and the manga; in the manga Sanosuke realized he had been killed after seeing his decapitated head on display as a warning, while in the anime a wounded Sōzō pushed Sanosuke to safety off a cliff in order to save him before dying himself.\\n\\nFull of anger and bitterness, Sanosuke made a living as a fighter-for-hire who bore the nickname \"Zanza\" derived from his weapon, the zanbatō. Sanosuke\\'s sword, the heaviest katana ever made in the Rurouni Kenshin universe, originates from the Ōnin Struggle. Due to wear the blade no longer has an edge. Sanosuke uses the sword to smash and crush.\\n\\nHiruma Kihei and Gohei hire Sanosuke to kill Himura Kenshin, but after the former assassin defeats Sanosuke and Sanosuke learns of the truth of Kenshin\\'s no-kill approach, Sanosuke becomes a valuable ally. He later adopts a boxing-like fighting skill, known for the strength of his right fist. Because the zanbatō broke during the fight, Sanosuke no longer wields it on a regular basis, using only one more time in the manga to defend the Kamiya dojo during the Jinchu arc.\\n\\nAt the end of the manga series, Sanosuke leaves Japan to avoid becoming wrongfully arrested and travels the world. He is not heard from until five years later during a reunion of the Kenshin-gumi, in which he tells them via a letter that he is in Mongolia and will stay there for a while before heading back to Japan.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

He's brave, strong, and has wisdom beyond his years that has come from the many battles he has fought in his life. However, all the battles he fought were for the losing side, and Kambei lives in the shadow of his painful and stigmatic past. He uses a stylized katana, though on several occasions, he uses two swords at once. He is selected by Kirara to lead the villagers against the bandits when her water crystal reacts to his passing in the city. At first Kambei disregards Katsushiro and Kikuchiyo as too inexperienced and immature to defend the village, but eventually recognizes both as full samurai and makes them the fifth and seventh, respectively.\"}},\n",

He is a member of the SRT (Special Response Team) of the Western Pacific Battle Group \"Tuatha de Danaan\". His call sign is Urzu-7 and his ID number is B-3128, and operates as team point-man as an Arm Slave specialist. \\n\\nIn addition to being a capable Arm Slave pilot, Sousuke is a specialist in Arm Slave operations and maintenance, improvised explosives, small arms, survival training, anti-armor combat, trap setting and camouflage. Additionally, he is proficient in logistics, demolitions, breach and forced entry, covert intrusion, and hand to hand combat. His background and experience as a guerrilla fighter, and later a mercenary soldier has made him much more sensitive and knowledgeable about tactics and methods more commonly used by guerrillas than government trained regulars. \\n\\nSousuke is unfortunately not very good at social interaction off the battlefield. He constantly causes many problems for Kaname Chidori due to his military nature. Even in school he carries a gun with him although it is loaded with non-lethal shells. He is also very bad at blending in with normal members of society due to his nature (i.e. following Kaname with stalker-like aspects and jumping off a train to follow her). That is, he has no readily available \"civil\" concepts about life, like entertainment or anything recreational and tends to horribly misinterpret the actions of people around him(like considering a guy who dumped his girlfriend a high-level tactician who is to be reckoned with). This is shown throughout the main series in multiple episodes, and the Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu! series focuses mainly on this aspect. This part of his personality is indeed one of the main sources of the series\\' humor. \\n\\nHis previous name during his guerrilla days was Kashim which was given to him by Majido, a strategist of the guerrilla forces in Helmajistan. \\n\\nIt is assumed that he changed his name to Sagara Sousuke when he left Helmajistan.

       "   'about': 'Ren is a shaman from China who came to Japan to fight Yoh Asakura and to take part in the Shaman Fight in Tokyo. In the American dub this is never mentioned. Ren starts off as a 13-year-old in the manga and the original Japanese anime, while in the English anime he first appears as a 15-year-old.\\n\\nHe is serious, logical, and emotionally aloof. He has become like this because of how he was raised. Because of his father, Ren had adapted a deep hatred towards humanity and a strong yearning to eliminate them all. He also believed that his spirit companion, Bason, was only meant to be used as a tool and to treat him as a friend would only result in the spirit taking advantage over him. Ren\\'s anger and hatred came from his father (or uncle in the English anime), Tao Yúan (Tao En). Forced to train and study at a very young age, Ren had his childhood stolen from him. He hated Tao En for all of his suffering.\\n\\nAs he gains the friendship of Yoh and the others, he realizes that everything he once believed about the world was not true. He learned to trust others and that humans weren\\'t as awful as he thought they were because Yoh and the others showed him that some people truly are kind. A new will to change himself took over. He wanted to let go of his hatred so he could be able to move on with his life, so he returned to China to defeat his father.\\n\\nHis first attempt failed, but he refused to give in to his father, even as he remained chained in the dungeon of his home. Thanks to Bason, Yoh and the others came to help him. He thanked them for rescuing him but was persistent in saying that he didn\\'t want any help from them. He said it was his problem alone. But eventually all of them defeated Tao Yúan together; allowing Ren to finally move on.\\n\\nRen tries hard to maintain a tough and confident exterior and is aloof, but deep down would risk his life for his allies. Ren is a particularly impatient person with a very short temper, and isn\\'t afraid to hurt the source of the anger.\\n\\nRen is an egotistical person and usually doesn\\'t care that people think that he\\'s overly proud. He even named his own team, \"Team the Ren,\" much to the annoyance of his teammate, Horohoro. His overflowing self-confidence annoys some of the other characters. In addition, Ren is also very intuitive, quick-witted, and sometimes stubborn. He is also very defiant. He rarely listens to what anyone says or takes their instructions. Before and during the process in which he befriended Yoh, he even was bold enough to disobey his father on various occasions.\\n\\nIt is mentioned that Ren is skilled in more than one area of combat. Not only is he a powerful shaman capable of doing things most shamans his age would not be able to, but in addition, he also seems to be skilled in martial arts and sword fighting, in addition to also learning many of Mikihisa Asakura\\'s techniques simply by experiencing them firsthand. It is also lightly suggested in the manga that Ren can also play the erhu.\\n\\nAs the series progresses, Ren begins to trust others more. Out of all his friends, his bonds with Yoh and Horohoro seem to be the strongest. Ren often fights with Horohoro and the two do not seem to get along at all. However, after Ren sacrifices himself to save him, it becomes apparent that they really do care for one another. As Faust worked to try to save Ren\\'s life after the incident, Horohoro did his best to protect the unconscious Ren.\\n\\nRen\\'s name in Chinese means \"benevolent,\" \"tough,\" and \"edge of a knife,\" all of which are reflected in his character. His actual Chinese name, Lián, means \"lotus\". In the English dub, he is given a British accent. He also has an obsession with milk and the number 3.\\n\\nHis Furyoku is 100,001 (as seen in chapter 276)\\n\\nIn Shaman King Character Book, there was an interview asking what kind of girl he likes and he said he would only like a girl if she\\'s smaller than him and not annoying. This must be the reason why he married Iron Maiden Jeanne and had a son named Men Tao.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

His guardian ghost is Kororo (\"Corey\" in the English anime), a spirit who is smitten with Manta Oyamada. Also in the manga, he becomes the third strongest of the Five Elemental Warriors and gains the Spirit of Rain. His furyoku is 120,000 (as seen in chapter 276). This, oddly, makes him \"technically\" stronger than both Yoh and Tao Ren, who have more importance in the series than him, who only have 108,000 and 100,001 furyoku respectively.\\n\\nHorohoro is good-natured and cheerful, but he gets serious in dangerous situations. He argues constantly with his teammate Tao Ren, and they do not seem to get along at all. However, it is shown that he really does care for him when, in the manga, he tells You Asakura that if he can\\'t save Ren, as his friend, HoroHoro would never forgive him. Horohoro is also very secretive about his past not willing to talk about it even to his friends. In addition, Horohoro can also get very competitive, even going so far as to turn Ryuu\\'s arms to ice and shatter them during the fight between The Ren and Funbari Onsen.

Tomo, expecting her to act like the stereotypical Osakan—loud, exuberant and fond of jokes—chose for her the nickname \"Osaka\", although Ayumu\\'s behavior could not be more different. Ayumu considers the name \"slow\" and \"spacey\", but she lacks the energy or motivation to dispute it. The nickname sticks so well that she is called Osaka by teachers and even in the class roster, to the point that no one remembers her real name. In the manga, Osaka mentions that she lived in Kobe when she was in elementary school and was born in Wakayama. Tomo, who says she doesn\\'t know where Wakayama is, tells Ayumu to \"just be Osaka\". \\n\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

Occasionally, such as when he is attacking oni, Haruka can transfigure into his true youkai form. His nails grow sharper and longer, his fangs grow longer, and his eyes constrict. Usually, he appears as a tall, dark-haired man with black wings that he can either hide or reveal. Haruka is troubled by his lack of memories, inability to eat youkai, and loss of power, which starts to affect his sense of self. Haruka's name under his previous master, an onmyodo practitioner, was Rin. As Rin, he did not have a good relationship with his master, and it is hinted that she took advantage of his subservient status for sexual purposes.\\n\\nSource: Wikipedia.\"}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Age: 16\\nBlood Type: A\\nBirthday: November 13\\nZodiac Sign: Scorpio\\n\\nTokiya is a second year student at Nashikiri High School, and he wields the madogu Ensui (\"Dark Water\"), a sword that utilizes water to create its blade and is capable of creating and controlling all three states of water (liquid, solid and gas). He is often referred to as by his last name, though his companions have made up nicknames for him, such as \"Mi-chan\" or \"Mi-bo\". \\n\\nDespite the difference in his age in the anime and manga, Tokiya wanted to take Yanagi from Recca because she looks exactly like his sister, Mifuyu Mikagami, who was murdered in front of his eyes when he was young. He uses the Hyomon Ken style which was developed specifically for the Ensui and the Hyoma En (a madogu that also controls water, but focuses more on water in its solid form). Tokiya joins forces with Recca in attempting to rescue Yanagi from Mori Koran\\'s mansion, and he continues to be part of their team throughout the rest of the series.\\n\\nTokiya in both the anime and manga is initially portrayed as callous and aloof; often insulting his teammates\\' abilities and intelligence. He is protective of Yanagi, who closely resembles late sister, and he is shown to be interested in her romantically in the manga. Other characters have often praise Tokiya for his intellect and composure during battle, with some going as far as to say that he might be the strongest Hokage member when it comes to normal battles. Another characteristic of his that makes him stand out among his teammates is the fact that he is more ruthless and cruel than the rest, a fact recognized by both Kurei and Mikoto, who both act as antagonists throughout most of the manga.\\n\\nCertain characteristics in Tokiya\\'s personality and appearance are different in the anime series as opposed to the manga and games. His hair is light blue in the manga and games, and brown in the anime series. In the booklet accompanying the Flame of Recca Original Soundtrack Vol. 2 CD, his age is listed as 17, while the filler page in the manga states that he is 16 years of age. Apart from these differences, Tokiya\\'s character development in the anime is not as obvious as it is in the manga, wherein he becomes more open to emotions other than his desire for vengeance towards the end of the series. Tokiya attributes this change to his encounter with Kai, a fellow Hyomon Ken practitioner, and his friends.'}},\n",

The series depicts her as extremely diligent, although she is also a natural genius.\\n\\nAs the series progresses, she learns to understand her mistakes and not think that she has to be perfect or else fail. For instance, after a rocky start to her training, during which she was dead last in her class at piloting, she takes the advice of Kouta Otoyama and realizes she was trying to keep track of far too much information on her ship displays. Her piloting improves dramatically as a result. Despite her early setbacks as a pilot, her programming abilities are top notch from the very start, and she eventually combines the two in order to become even more formidable in the cockpit. She is called Shipon because the first time she piloted one of the Biancas she flew around like a ping-pong ball.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

She is a rather naive young girl. Risa starts to develop a crush, then an obsession, with Dark upon seeing his attempt to steal an artwork broadcast over the news claiming that he is the mysterious person whom she is destined to be with.\\n\\nThere is an ongoing sisterly rivalry between her and Riku. Compared to her sister she seems more innocent and clumsier and can be seen as your typical \"girly-girl\" though shows the same stubbornness, tenacity, and kindness as Riku. She would much rather prefer fashion and relationships than to physical activities. In terms of physical features her hair is much longer and she has a \"softer voice,\" apart from that the two can\\'t be distinguished (shown in episode 5 of the anime when the two switch places so Risa can get out of chopping cabbage as a form of after school punishment).\\n\\nRisa obsessively pursues Dark, coming up with intricate schemes and plans to make him go out with her, some of which eventually work. There\\'s no doubt that she is quite clever and very persistent. Later on, however, Dark tells her that the two of them cannot see each other anymore. Near the end of the anime, subtle signs of a relationship between Risa and Satoshi start to show. (example: he places her on a park bench and covers her body with his jacket after she fell unconscious during their struggles with Krad. She then wakes up only to find the jacket and a single white feather which fell from it. Although not knowing who the jacket and feather belongs to, she can be seen treasuring it). In the manga this is more apparent, shown through small occurrences (example: he saves her when she fell off a building, when Daisuke saves her from drowning he shows concern and touches a lock of her hair).\\n\\nAs the series progresses, Risa breaks out of being a naive little girl and develops into a more mature young lady.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Chiyo Mihama , usually called Chiyo-chan, is a child prodigy, having skipped five grades to 10th grade (first year in Japanese high school) at the start of the series yet is still top of the class. Such grade-skipping would be unthinkable in Japan, and the series humorously explores its potential consequences. The other characters find Chiyo amazingly cute, but sometimes take advantage of both her youthfulness and her scholastic abilities. Her diminutive stature leads to her having a lack of confidence, particularly in sports where she fears she is a burden to others. Chiyo is frequently viewed with jealousy by fellow students, initially because of her intelligence, but later also because of the discovery that her family is exceedingly wealthy (they own an enormous mansion and a summer house which Chiyo invites her classmates to visit on several occasions). The stylistic rendering of Chiyo\\'s pigtails allow for several visual gags in both the manga and anime: Osaka often imagines them to be flapping wings, or as entities independent of Chiyo herself. At home, she can almost always be found in the company of her enormous dog, Tadakichi-san. Of all of the girls, she is the only one who does not sit through college \"entrance exams\" as she intends to study overseas, possibly in America.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Age: 16-17\\nBirthday: October 8\\nHeight: 158 cm (5\\'2\")\\nBlood type: AB\\nOccupation: Student (grade 10-11), Ultra Director, Ultra Detective, Brigade Chief and Founder\\n\\nBackground\\nHaruhi Suzumiya, a first year student at North High School (in novels 1-8), and second year (in the 9th and latest novel), can be characterized as funny, eccentric, and somewhat unpredictable. In the series, she is introduced declaring her interests in aliens, espers and time travelers and does not care for \"ordinary\" human beings. The last thing on her mind is a normal high school life. With a burning desire to find such phenomena in the world, she is generally unapproachable and finds ordinary people boring and uninteresting. As a result of this, many of her classmates choose to avoid and confront her. She deals with her emotions by creating a parallel universe, where she inadvertently releases transparent creatures who tear up and destroy everything that comes into contact with them. Espers are the ones who can stop these creatures by cutting and destroying them, because if these creatures are left alone destroying everything as well as the outer barrier it could affect the outside world. She also likes to dress up Mikuru in random outfits.\\n\\nKyon is the first character to engage with her in a serious conversation. From this encounter, she gradually begins to soften up to others and starts to open up with her classmates. Later on, Haruhi took Kyon against his will and forced him to help her start the SOS Brigade, thus she has taken an unknown interests to Kyon later in the series. It is hinted that one of the reasons as to why Haruhi opened up to Kyon was that he resembled John Smith; John Smith and Kyon are the same person.\\n\\nShe is noted as smart, athletic, and naturally talented in any extra-curricular activities. She once joined every activity club in her school and quit because she found them boring, despite pleas by the club members for her membership. Her musical talent was highlighted when she stood in as the emergency lead singer and guitarist, along with Yuki, for the band ENOZ during the school festival.\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonality\\nAt first, Haruhi seems very indifferent and cold but underneath that front she is very spontaneous, upbeat, and hyperactive. Her determination, persistence, and resourcefulness drive her endeavors of finding strange phenomenon and promoting the SOS Brigade. Because of her dedication, she becomes hot-headed when things don\\'t go her way. Hand-in-hand with her cleverness and creativity, and a certain ruthlessness, even seeming amorality, she can often get what she wants, an example of such is when she blackmailed the Computer Society President into giving her a brand new computer for the SOS Brigade. Haruhi tends to pursue her goals regardless of who gets in the way, or is hurt, such as Mikuru in the aforementioned blackmail. She also has a tendency to be jealous and angry when Kyon gets too friendly with any girl. Evidently, the universe was almost destroyed and recreated when Haruhi\\'s jealousy was pushed too far.\\n\\nHaruhi also has a very competitive personality and accepts without hesitation any challenge that crosses her, regardless of difficulty or time constraint. Her constant optimism and over-confidence make her seem arrogant. She has very high standards and won\\'t accept anything less than perfection from herself and her Brigade. She places a lot of trust in her Brigade members, especially Kyon, to get the task done whatever it may be. This can sometimes make her seem selfish and unkind.\\n\\nShe is not shy and often attracts a lot of attention to the point of not minding changing clothes in front of various people, more so when her SOS Brigade is in mind. When it comes to Mikuru she is very physically playful. She often comments on Mikuru\\'s attractiveness and seems to find a kind of enjoyment in exploiting it to her own ends, often through forcing Mikuru into and out of various costumes such as a bunny girl costume as if she were a human dress-up doll.\\n\\n\\n\\nSOS Brigade role\\nHaruhi is the founder and \"Brigade Chief\" of the SOS Brigade, or Saving The World by Overloading it with Fun Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade. She was unable to find any existing club suitable to her preferences. She made the group in order to find and have fun with aliens, espers, and time travelers. Upon creation, she names herself as its leader. Her method of finding and recruiting members is to \"voluntarily arrest\" them then force them to join.\\n\\nThe SOS Brigade is very precious to her and has stated to Kyon that she has no intention of yielding her position as Chief to anyone else. She will go to any lengths, even by exploiting the members, to bring attention and support for her Brigade such as procuring room and materials, maintaining their website, participating in sports tournaments, organizing activities such as city-wide searches for strange phenomenon among other things. She wrote, produced, and directed the Brigade\\'s amateur-movie The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina for the school festival.'}},\n",

Itsuki has confirmed to Kyon once that his outer personality is merely an artificial image he fakes in accordance to Haruhi\\'s impression of him, and hints that his true character is something quite different, being \"less pleasing\" in the eyes of others. Maintaining his casual, constantly smiling self, however, is vital for keeping Haruhi\\'s mentality balanced.\\n\\nOut of the three Brigade members, Kyon is the least fond of Itsuki. He often finds himself annoyed with Itsuki\\'s plastic smile, his willingness to acquiesce to Haruhi\\'s outrageous schemes, playful teasing and his various forays into his psychological and philosophical theories (e.g., omphalos hypothesis, Anthropic principle, etc.). He is also distrustful of Itsuki\\'s intentions, comparing him to Yuki Nagato when it comes to deciphering his expressions. Itsuki\\'s fondness for speculation often causes him to produce explanations for situations involving the SOS Brigade, its members and related events. Ironically, Itsuki can only share his theories with Kyon and also enthusiastically plays different kinds of board games with him to pass the time, despite losing all the time, although Kyon suspects that he may be doing so on purpose.'}},\n",

At the beginning of the series, Sakuragi was a slacker, always trying to ask girls out but getting constantly rejected (the 50th rejection occurring at the start of the series). He then met Akagi Haruko, with whom he fell in love immediately. This passion led to him joining the Shohoku basketball team. However, as a complete beginner, he was not able to keep up with the rest of the team at first despite his physical attributes (great height, athleticism, stamina, speed and leaping ability). He regards himself as a genius though, with self-confidence that borders on arrogance. His most recognizable trait is his red hair, though he shaves his head as reparation for an error that led to the loss against Kainan.\\n\\nAt first, Sakuragi was known for his poor basketball skills as a beginner; in his first few official matches, he fouled out every game. However, his basketball skills advanced throughout the series. First he developed his basic skills, such as dribbling and layups. Then, trained by Akagi, he became a formidable rebounder; his rebounding became his claim to fame throughout the latter half of the series. He also is seen more than once defining the match for Shohoku in the last seconds, for instance, by dunking a ball that Akagi would have missed in the league round match with Ryonan. His jump shooting was then developed by Coach Anzai, who had him make 20,000 shots in a week. He hit a buzzer-beating jump shot to win the match against Sannoh. However, he also injured his back during the match against Sannoh, and underwent rehabilitation after Shohoku's subsequent loss to Aiwa Academy.\\n\\nIn spite of the setbacks he has had to face, Sakuragi displays a great deal of tenacity and determination that carry him through and help reciprocate for his other failings, both on and off the court. Although his love for Haruko and rivalry with Rukawa are the main driving forces motivating him to succeed in basketball, his injury during the Sannoh match makes him realize that he has actually come to love the game, leading him to give his all for his team and bring them victory. \\n\\n(Source: Hoopedia)\"}},\n",

The only traits they share are that they are not academically inclined and good fighters. He regards Sakuragi as an idiot and both normally fight. Actually, he knows Sakuragi can put his talents to a better use, but is ashamed to see the immaturity with which he deals with things. His hobby is sleeping, and is usually seen asleep whenever he\\'s not on the court; he can even ride his bike while asleep often crashing with objects when doing so. Waking Rukawa from a nap is considered unforgivable, since he will almost automatically beat up the culprit. Unsurprisingly, he has also been in his fair share of off-court fights, but can hold his own. Rukawa\\'s goal is to be the best high school player in Japan, and he considers Sendoh of Ryonan to be his greatest rival. A fact being that he is often nicknamed the \"super-rookie\", the \"ace of Shohoku\", even. \\n\\nRukawa is extremely good at basketball, and possesses a wide range of skills to complement his height, athleticism and drive to win. Despite being merely a first-year high school player, he is the undisputed ace of Shohoku\\'s team. In the Kanagawa Interhigh Tournament, he was named one of the top five players, the only first year player so honored. He has managed to change the course of many games, such as when he single-handedly brought Shohoku back from a double-digit deficit against Kainan (Rukawa scored 15 straight points for Shohoku in 2 minutes and 5 seconds just before the end of the first half). However, his style was criticized as being too selfish, and he sometimes comes into conflict with his teammates for various reasons; this was one of the reasons why Coach Anzai refused to give him his blessing when Rukawa told him that he intended to go to the USA, and told him to become the best in Japan before he even thought of it. When he was outplayed by Sawakita during the match against Sannoh Technical, though, he realized what Sendoh reminded him as a challenge: To defeat Sendoh, Rukawa had to change his style and pass the ball. It was his pass that led to Hanamichi\\'s buzzer-beating shot, winning the match. Rukawa is subsequently named a member of the All-Japan basketball team. \\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

Despite having opportunities to join more prestigious high schools like Ryonan, he choose to go to Shohoku because of Coach Anzai; Anzai had given him the courage to win in the Junior High tournament by encouraging him during the last seconds of the match. However, an injury to his left knee in a training session interrupted his basketball career. An imprudent early return to the basketball court reinjured the knee more severely, leading to a basketball hiatus of over a year.\\n\\nAlthough he eventually healed, he was embittered by his exclusion from the court, and Mitsui quit basketball and became the leader of a gang. His gang got in a fight with Miyagi, and during the fight, Miyagi beat Mitsui senseless before taking a beating himself.\\n\\nAfterwards, Mitsui attempted to ruin the basketball team by instigating them into fighting with his gang, as the team would have been banned from competition for fighting. In the end, Sakuragi's own gang—Yohei, Takamiya, Ookusu and Noma—voluntarily took the blame for the fight, and Mitsui was filled with remorse when he saw Anzai again. He rejoined the team and vowed never to fight again.\\n\\nMitsui is best known on the team as a three-point specialist, though his skills extend to other areas; during a practice match, he once managed to shut down Sakuragi, playing center. His defensive ability completely shut down Fukuda's scoring abilities. His three-pointers helped Shohoku catch up when they were 12 points down against Shoyo, and again when the team was 20 points down against Sannoh in the National Championships. His greatest weakness, though, is his lack of stamina due to his long break from playing basketball. Thus, in the latter halves of games, he has not always been as reliable—he missed a potential game-winning shot against Kainan and collapsed on-court during the game against Ryonan.\\n\\n(Source: hoopiedia)\"}},\n",

Despite at first not thinking too much of Sakuragi (who addresses him as \"Gori\" for gorilla due to his immense physical presence), he actually realizes Sakuragi\\'s potential as a basketball player. Serious and disciplined, Akagi\\'s dream is to lead Shohoku to the national championship. His determination is shown in the match against Kainan, where he played on despite a serious injury to his ankle. Akagi considers Uozumi of Ryonan to be his biggest rival, though their rivalry is not antagonistic; indeed, there is respect that borders on friendship.\\n\\nAkagi differs from the other starters in two respects. First, he is the most academically talented out of all them and is considered a model student. After the loss to Aiwa knocks Shohoku out of the Nationals, Akagi leaves the team along with Kogure to study for the college entrance exams. In contrast, the other four had to beg their teacher to be given the chance to retake some exams they had flunked; they would otherwise have been disqualified from playing in the Nationals for having failed too many classes. Second, Akagi is the only starter not to have gotten into an actual fight, although he has used physical force against his own players (most notably Sakuragi, and once Mitsui after the gym fight) to keep them in line. He is the only other character besides Rukawa able to take one of Sakuragi\\'s trademark headbutts without being knocked out and the only other character who has had Sakuragi inadvertently dunk a ball on his head (Murasame of Miuradai was the second, in the manga; in the anime, the second one to be dunked on the head is Naito, also from Miuradai).\\n\\nRegarded as the best center in the Kanagawa prefecture, Akagi plays as a fairly typical center, using his height and power to score close to the basket. He also has a reputation for being a virtually unbeatable defender. As captain of the team, he keeps discipline among his players during matches. Akagi met his match during the game against Sannoh, in the form of Masashi Kawata, considered one of the best centers at the high school level. Initially intimidated when Kawata outplayed him, he regained his confidence thanks to Uozumi\\'s encouragement and led his team to victory. \\n\\n(Source: hoopedia.nba.com)'}},\n",

She is a young girl who attacked Yuuichi Aizawa out-of-the-blue in the middle of town early on in the story. She was then carried back to Yuuichi and Nayuki Minase\\'s house, where she lived as a guest for the remainder of her story. Despite having lost her memories, she remembered what her name was and is sure of is that she holds a grudge against Yuuichi from the past when he visited the city back when he was younger. Makoto\\'s amnesia, or memory loss, is much more severe than Yuuichi\\'s or Ayu Tsukimiya\\'s, but from an entirely different source. When it comes to her opinion on taking in small animals as pets, she feels sad that pets sometimes are abandoned when their owners cannot take care of them. Due to this attitude, it takes her a while to warm up to a stray cat she finds halfway through her story which she later names Piro. Makoto is shown to love Piro very much and will often carry the cat around on her head. \\n\\nFrom early on, it becomes obvious that Makoto has a mischievous personality, which leads to her performing various pranks. These are done exclusively on Yuichi because of her strong dislike for him, something she constantly reaffirms. Her persistent attempts at pranks on Yuuichi vary in severity, such as simply dropping food on him or once even throwing lit firecrackers in his room. As time passes and Makoto beings to feel more as a member of the Minase family rather than a stranger, she honestly grows to like Yuuichi, effectively looking beyond her latent distaste for him. \\n\\nMakoto can be clueless about things that people her age should know, such as the fact that she can buy her own meat buns and manga; Yuuichi had commented once how she lacked common sense due to a lack of social experience. Like Ayu, she too has an idiosyncratic expression, \"auu~\", which she says when she is frustrated or sad; likewise, it has no real meaning. Another unique speech pattern of hers is that she always refers to herself in the third person. Near the end of her story, Makoto starts to wear two bells around her right wrist and enjoys the sound they make. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Akiko is Nayuki Minase\\'s mother and Yuichi Aizawa\\'s aunt whose main role is in Nayuki\\'s arc. She has blue hair that is a little lighter and more purple-tinged than Nayuki\\'s hair. She is a little bit taller than her daughter, and instead of letting her hair fall down like Nayuki\\'s, she keeps it in a long braid, which she usually places on her right shoulder. Like Nayuki\\'s, her hair parts at the top of her head and falls down the sides. Akiko has a light complexion and has light blue eyes. She is usually seen smiling. Akiko most often wears a light pink jacket over a white, long-sleeved shirt. \\n\\nAkiko is a kind and caring person. She is a great cook, and is proud of her special and unique jam, which no one likes. It\\'s unknown if she has tasted it or if she likes it. She tends to answer yes and no very quickly, usually in one second. For example, when Makoto wanted to keep Piro, she said yes right after the question. Since, she is a mother, she can cook, clean, and will always be there if someone needs her. \\n\\nShe works at an unspecified job and takes care of the house, cooking various types of food, most of which is good except for her infamous \"special\" homemade jam which she alone enjoys the taste of. She appears to not realize exactly what is going on around her, taking in strays such as Makoto Sawatari and assuming lame excuses for her behavior. She may just realize that Makoto is a good person and can be cured of her anger, which is true. Akiko certainly exhibits more knowledge of the situation than Yuichi as far as the origins of Ayu Tsukimiya and Makoto are concerned, hinting that she is familiar with the supernatural goings-on in the town and how they apply to Yuichi. Akiko is very important to Nayuki since she does not have a father. Akiko is known to be very easy-going and is constantly smiling. She will not even resort to stern lectures, such as when Makoto spends money on herself that Akiko gave her to buy food. Akiko can be assertive, though she never has once raised her voice in anger or otherwise. She will often give responses to questions within one second of being asked, the answer almost always marking approval.\\n\\nAkiko has some indirect involvement with Makoto Sawatari\\'s and Ayu Tsukimiya\\'s arcs. After Yuichi brought Makoto home for the first time, Akiko shows no intentions of throwing her out or handing her over to the police. She decided to house Makoto for the time being until they could find her parents or until she remembered something. With Ayu, Akiko asked her to stay at their house upon discovering that both of Ayu\\'s parents were out of town. Akiko\\'s main involvement is with her daughter Nayuki\\'s arc. From when Nayuki was very young, Akiko raised her daughter alone; no information is given about Nayuki\\'s father or what happened to him after Nayuki\\'s birth. As such, Akiko and Nayuki are very close and never get in fights with each other. \\n\\n\\n\\n(Source: Kanon Wiki)'}},\n",

Two years ago, he had an abrupt change of personality and became the opposite of his former self. Before, he was a popular, average grade student; now, he doesn\\'t get along with his classmates, but he gets perfect scores. Along with the personality change, he suffered a loss of all his memories. The cause of these drastic changes is still unknown, although he has regular therapy sessions to determine why.\\n\\nRitsuka, on his first day at his new school, meets Soubi Agatsuma for the first time. Soubi confuses him with his sudden intimacy and puzzling claims that he was Seimei\\'s fighter. As Ritsuka discovers, Seimei\\'s impromptu will dictates that Soubi shall \"become Ritsuka\\'s\" upon his death. Ritsuka deeply admired and idolized Seimei, and to discover later there were many things kept secret came as a great shock. It further poisoned his difficulty in trusting others, particularly Soubi.\\n\\nDespite his young age and inexperience due to his amnesia, Ritsuka is very intelligent and approaches things with startling maturity. The circumstances of his life encourage his lack of innocence; however, there have been notable incidents that bare his still-strong naivety, particularly in sexual love and dating. Despite this, he still has firm opinions and unrelenting ideas about those subjects. It is these opinions that clash dramatically with adults and authority figures around him, most notably Soubi. Ritsuka is a pacifist, and strongly opposes violence under any circumstance. Soubi has remained fairly silent on the issue; however, he seemingly doesn\\'t object to pain and punishment under certain circumstances.\\n\\nLove is an uncomfortable subject for Ritsuka. He is wary of compliments, and doesn\\'t like hearing phrases such as \"I like you.\" Early on in the series, Soubi says \"I love you\" frequently, which Ritsuka doesn\\'t believe is true. Because of Ritsuka\\'s cynical reaction, Soubi stops saying it altogether after volume 2 of the manga. Still, Ritsuka\\'s inner conflict over whether he believes what Soubi says becomes a source of great tension and bitterness in their relationship. \\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Birthday: August 3, 1975\\n\\nA 22-year-old, hormonal, blonde-haired biker and virgin, Onizuka Eikichi graduated from a bottom-rung university by cheating and, as such, cannot get a decent job. His main way of spending time is peering up girls\\' skirts in a local mall. He is very athletic, as he can bench press 150 kg (331 lbs), has a second dan black belt in karate, and even claims to perform 500 push-ups, 1000 pull ups and 2000 squats daily.\\n\\nThrough the events explained in the Great Teacher Onizuka manga, Onizuka decides to become a teacher, even though it is later implied that he has an IQ of about 50 (Though not necessarily true). His initial teacher training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki\\'s problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with his students, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead.\\n\\nUnfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers\\' civil service exam. As a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. He manages to get a job at the upper-crust Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of vice-principal Uchiyamada Hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. Of course, one of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school—in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access—and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Yoshikawa Noboru from committing suicide.\\n\\nOnizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. Not only does he survive the class\\'s brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of Great Teacher Onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own.\\n\\nIt is later implied again, during the National Exams, that Onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. His exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. However, when Yoshito Kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about Onizuka\\'s true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. He checks with Onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach).\\n\\nOnizuka has incredible physical resilience. On more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. Onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character Heihachi from the Tekken series of fighting games, and Jason Voorhees from the films called Friday the 13th (series)). His fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage.\\n\\nIn spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he\\'s acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Kanzaki Urumi kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&amp;M garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Yet another example is when Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that Onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (Onizuka was playing \"where\\'s the nipple\" with his daughter, at a karaoke bar in town).\\n\\nHis personal mode of transportation is a Kawasaki Z2 motorcycle 750cc type S. The bike itself is also featured heavily in the prequel series to GTO.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Revy (レヴィ), sometimes referred by her full name Rebecca (レヴェッカ), is the female protagonist of the series. She does most of the fighting for the Lagoon Company. Very little is revealed about her past, although portions can be pieced together through the series. Revy is a Chinese-American born and raised in Chinatown, Manhattan, near Mott Street, spending most of her youth as a thief and murderer. Flashbacks throughout the series reveal that Revy may have honed her skills with firearms by shooting at cans, and that her first murder may have involved shooting an unknown man while using a pillow. It is unknown whether the pillow was used to suppress the noise or to help avoid looking at her first victim.\\n\\n\\nRevy is very competitive, easily bored, and extremely ill-tempered. Unlike Rock, she is undiplomatic, believing in the use of brute force and coercion to get her way. In contrast to this, she\\'s revealed to be highly ticklish.\\n\\nRevy is a merciless and sadistic killer, without a conscience, who will kill anyone at the slightest provocation, even unarmed civilians (as seen in episode 6). Dutch once made reference to University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman in describing Revy after she slaughtered the crew of the Neo-Nazis\\' boat after a previous conversation with Rock brought up some unpleasant memories, resulting in an internal fit of rage - she even threatened Rock with death if he ever questions or tampers with her way of life. Of all the characters in the series, Revy uses the most foul language. She takes maniacal glee in killing anyone and everyone. She is also a heavy smoker and drinker.\\n\\nShe has a changing but volatile attitude towards Rock; though she respects him later in the series, she is mostly hostile towards him. She shot Rock at point blank range, but he moved her gun at the last second, during a confrontation in episode 7, and in episode 1 emptied most of a magazine in his direction while arguing with Dutch about their hostage. However, she does have a tendency to save Rock from critical situations, and later on she admits to considering Rock as family to Balalaika. It is possible that she has an attraction to Rock, based on her reactions to Eda\\'s teasing, which appear to be jealousy.\\n\\nAccording to CIA agents on Basilan Island, towards the end of episode 12, Revy is still notorious in the NYPD, particularly at the 27th Precinct. Since the 27th Precinct does not exist in real-life New York City, this throwaway reference may - or may not - indicate an odd connection to Dick Wolf\\'s Law and Order franchise. This is further suggested in a later episode, when Revy specifically mentions the series.\\n\\nRevy is one of the deadliest fighters in the series, whose skill with firearms and ability to dodge bullets is almost superhuman and unparallelel. There are only a few other characters, such as Roberta and Ginji, that can hold their ground against her in combat.\\n\\nHer weapons of choice are a pair of modified Beretta 92FS\\'s; which are made out of stainless steel and had their barrels extended from 4.9\" to 5.9\" each (the 5.9\" is the combat MOD barrel) and also adapted for silencers. They are engraved with \"9mm Sword Cutlass\" on both sides, as well as the Jolly Roger of the infamous pirate Calico Jack (which is also inlaid into the ivory grips), and a manufacture inscription in Thai. Due to her ambidextrous marksmanship skills, she is nicknamed \"Two Hand\" by the denizens of Roanapur. However, Revy has been seen using a variety of other firearms.\\n\\nConstantly living on the edge of life, Revy has developed a rather bleak, almost nihilistic outlook on life, relying only on her own power, skills, and money. She does not believe in God or emotions. However, she seems to respect and trust her companions.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

He shows a great respect for L, basing much of how he solves crime on L\\'s methods, even to the point where he only takes cases that he is interested with rather than trying to pursue justice.

Awkward and funny at the beginning of the adventure, Mibu Kyoushirou is, in fact, a frightening combatant called \"the Demon-God\" who is the only one to have beaten Kyou. Kyoushirou has the ability to transfer human souls. He uses this to transfer Kyou\\'s soul into his own body while hiding Kyou\\'s body. He killed many people in the past, including the brother of Shiina Yuya, Shiina Nozomu. He is actually a high ranked Mibu and is gifted in the handling of a sword and is thought to be the best swordsman of the clan to date. He knows the techniques of the Mumyou Jinpu Ryuu and is also the former owner of the Shibien. As far as areas of comparison go, his skill and potential rank him equal to Kyo and just below the former Crimson King.\\n\\nHis only wish is to protect Sakuya, whom he is in love with along with Kyou before the battle of Sekigahara. It is seen in the manga that he had always been in love with Sakuya and Kyou is a dear, close friend who cares for them both. He cares greatly for Yuya and would do anything to protect her, saying he will not let Kyou have her. Also, it is noted by Sasuke how Kyoushirou looks at Yuya tenderly as seen in Chapter 234.\\n\\nMibu Kyoushirou is one of the Red Cross Knights, created from the flesh and blood of the former Aka no Ou. He was a killing machine, but he had a very friendly heart, he only became friendly with Sakuya\\'s influence. He was also a master of Mumyo Jinpu Ryuu Satsujin Ken. He once wielded the Shibien, one of Muramasa\\'s Devil Swords, and killed many people with it until the sword turned black in color because it absorbed too much blood.\\n\\nIn the end of the manga it is shown that Kyoushirou is living with Sakuya and visits Yuya and Kyou.'}},\n",

When Kyo awakens in volume 3, he makes Benitora his #2 servant after a short fight.\\n\\nDuring the Forest Arc, he fights a former fellow disciple of his master, Mekira II. Mekira has the upper hand for most of the fight thanks to a hypnotic technique, but Benitora eventually sees through it and kills Mekira with a special technique of his own, although doing so exacerbates his injuries.\\n\\nWhen Nobunaga reappears and overwhelms Kyo, Benitora intervenes, blocking the killing blow and briefly fighting Nobunaga one-on-one. He is completely outmatched, but eventually manages to unhorse Nobunaga with another secret technique, the reverse Hassun, almost killing himself in the process; he is saved from death at Nobunaga's hands by the revitalized Kyo.\\n\\nHe had a great part in Mibu arc, he fought Taihaku, the leader of Goyosei and won.

       "   'about': \"Sanada Yukimura is a famous general who lost the battle of Sekigahara and ultimately Japan. He escaped Kudoyama and planned the assassination of Tokugawa Ieyasu, though it was never carried out. Yukimura travels with Kyo in order to defeat the Mibu Clan and Oda Nobunaga. In doing so, this would free Japan from the Mibu Clan's shadow governing and give Yukimura a chance at taking over Japan.\\n\\nYukimura is shadowed by a team of elite ninja called the Sanada Juuyuushi. His sword techniques are unnamed, but he uses the Sekireigan, which was taught to him by Anri. Yukimura can utilize the Sekireigan to access extreme speed, but Anri instructed him to never use it more than five times a day.\\n\\nWhen he was young, his childhood girlfriend was killed in a massacre that could have been avoided, but was not for strategic reasons. He seems to have greatly admired the Toyotomi clan's founder, Hideyoshi, when he talked about his past, and the reason to his other given name Toyotomi Nobushige.\\n\\nIn volume 26, he fights and defeats Shindara. He also fights Kyo to a draw in volume 27, both of them using their most powerful techniques, however Kyo is not in his true body, nor has he awakened his true red eyes. Yukimura shows big progress throughout the story, but most of it occurs off the page, with Yukimura simply leaving the main party and returning a stronger warrior. He trains with Anri, one of Muramasa's guards, who teaches him the Sekireigan. With this he is able to move extremely fast and attack from many angles simultaneously. He later faces both Chinmei and the Former Crimson King himself, though he loses to the King, he is able to defeat Chinmei with the help of Sasuke and the Juuyuushi. Although he is not on Kyo nor Kyoshiro's level at the end, he is clearly as strong as the Four Emperors.\\n\\nYukimura is renowned for his casual, cheerful demeanour; he is almost always seen with a smile and often seems very preoccupied with seducing beautiful women and drinking sake. He is thirty-seven years old, and attributes his youthful appearance to good skin care. Despite this, he can be terrifying when he is enraged. He is also notable for his treatment of his ninja followers, whom he cares about and respects deeply as members of his family. As a result, the Juuyuushi are not only loyal to him, but care about him personally.\\n\\nYukimura hates Ieyasu more than anything. It is interesting to note that historically, Yukimura had already fought Ieyasu's son, Hidetada (Benitora), at the battle of Ueda Castle. This is briefly mentioned in the anime and possibly the manga. It is a battle which is believed to have ended in Yukimura's loss.\"}},\n",

Also, while the Magic Knights are facing Inouva's true form, Ferio regains his memory from his younger years. He realizes that he was Princess Emeraude's only younger brother, and hears his sister's voice coming from his own orb, telling him how to defeat Inouva. Ferio relays the info to the Knights and they manage to kill their enemy. \\n\\nIn the OVA, he is initially a villain who can summon and control swarms of insects. He appears to have a close relationship with Ascot, and in a twist of his original character, he is the villain who does battle with Fuu. After eavesdropping on Lantis' conversation with Hikaru and the others, he assists Lantis in fighting Cephiro's spirits, and later delivers Lantis' sword to the combined Mashin to help them fight Eagle. \\n\\nFerio gets his name from the Honda Civic Ferio, and Ascot's monster from the episode featuring Ferio is named after the Mitsubishi Pajero. \\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)\"}},\n",

       "   'about': 'A boy who first appeared reading a book that Shizuku had left behind. In the book, Shizuku left her song lyrics inside, and Seiji read them. He, in reality, like them, but when Shizuku returned to retrieve her book, he called the lyrics corny, which caused her to call him a jerk. He\\'s frequently seen riding his bicycle during the movie. Like once when Shizuku forgot her lunch in his grandfather\\'s shop, he returned the lunch to her, with his bicycle. He playfully comments on the enormous amounts of food inside the lunch, asking her if she eats that much. Shizuku again yells at him.\\nTheir first real pleasant encounter is when Shizuku stops Shiro Nishi\\'s (Seiji\\'s grandfather) store while it\\'s closed. She explains to Seiji that she wanted to see The Baron again. So Seiji takes her inside the shop and shows her the cat, he even let\\'s the sun glisten in in the cat\\'s eye. Shizuku is mesmerized by it. \\nSeiji is an aspiring violin crafter. He even plays a little bit, yet he really loves making them. He wants to become a professional, much to his parent\\'s dismay. He says that only his grandfather supports him. Shizuku pleads him to play a little, and he agrees on one condition. Shizuku must sing along. So the two of them play and sing the song \"Country Road\". Midway through the song, Seiji\\'s grandfather comes with two of his friends and they join in. This is when Seiji and Shizuku first become great friends.'}},\n",

He wields the power to control blood, including blood drawn from his enemies. Early in the manga, he fights Belze together with Kyoko, although the battle has no outcome due to the intervention of Shiki to bring both members back to the Apostles\\' helicopter. Later, he sees that Durham is killed after he is taken down by Train. He leaves the Apostles of the Stars, together with Kyoko, over an ideological split with Creed, as he considers Creed\\'s bloodlust is blinding his original sense of justice that formed the Apostles of the Stars, but continues to battle Chronos. He meets Train and Sven later in the plot. In the last chapter of the series Charden is seen coughing up blood, implying that he is dying. Charden\\'s Tao Power is called \"Blood\".\\n\\n\\nCharden Flamberge in the Anime\\n\\nSame as in the manga, except the battle against Belze does not take place, and his leaving of the Apostles takes place at a different time. He makes a reappearance near the end of the anime, though his trademark sunglasses and silk top hat are no longer worn as well as him keeping his hair tied back. He decides to aid Train and the group in the cause of stopping Eden, by fighting the Zero numbers at the end, while Train and Sven head for the upper levels to save Eve also when he tries to talk to Sephiria there is a flash back of them fighting but there battle it self is not shown.\\n\\nSource: Wikipedia'}},\n",

It's suggestive throughout the series and manga that her feelings for Jo might be romantic, possibly bisexual since she's into men.

Her true hair color is not red, but actually black.\\n\\nShe was once an orphan in New York City, but managed to encounter Jo. At first she was reluctant to keep Jo around because of her destructive capabilities, but after some time they learn to appreciate and trust each other. After they took Sei's offer as employees of Bai-lan, they have been performing supportive roles for Jo's missions. Meg often would be an undercover agent for info and provide cover fire for Jo.

A childhood friend of Chika, she lives next door to the Ito house and attends the same class as Chika. Miu likes to say random things out of the blue and often plays pranks on Matsuri and Ana, but is most of the time interrupted by Nobue (and sometimes by Chika), ending up lying face-down on the floor. She has the least common sense or manners of the girls, and is rarely taken seriously because of her weird ideas and comments. She seems to harbor some sort of jealousy of Ana and Matsuri, because Nobue finds them cuter. Miu is nicknamed \"Micchan\".'}},\n",

She often tries to \"borrow\" money from Chika to buy cigarettes. Nobue is perpetually searching for a part-time job to earn money for more cigarettes to calm her nicotine addiction.\\n\\nThe story suggests that Nobue derives some kind of sensual pleasure from watching the girls do cute things. In this respect, Nobue appears to appreciate the moe aesthetic. It is seen during the anime that Nobue prefers Matsuri and Ana over Chika and Miu.\\n\\nThe Nobue character changed from the manga to the anime. In the manga, she is a sixteen-year-old high school freshman, while in the anime she is a twenty-year-old junior-college student. Her age is presumably changed because of her smoking and drinking habit, both becoming legal in Japan at age twenty. Although in the first episode of the anime she introduces herself as a sixteen-year-old, this was intended to be a joke as she quickly stated that she was twenty. \\n\\nShe tends to act somewhat less mature in her manga incarnation, doing things such as tricking Matsuri into thinking that Miu is dead. Her appearance changes radically in the early stages of the manga, especially her hair, which goes from blond to dark brown (and is black in the anime).'}},\n",

       "   'about': \"The Captain is a member of the Millennium forces and the Waffen-SS.\\n\\nThe Captain is Major Montana Max's silent, stoic adjutant and bodyguard. Unlike the Major and Lieutenant Rip van Winkle, he still wears a full uniform, which is similar to a M42 Greatcoat with its neckguard constantly turned up, and an M43 officer's cap emblazoned with the Totenkopf symbol. The Captain is a natural werewolf, able to transform at will and fight in either human or werewolf form. Hans once fought Walter and Alucard in WWII, and meets the Hellsing forces later in London. His seemingly noble behaviour does not fit very well in with the rest of Millennium, and his enigmatic behaviour makes one wonder what he is fighting for.\\n\\nThe Captain possesses immense superhuman ability, even while in human form. This includes superhuman senses, strength (strong enough to bend steel bars or shatter limbs with a single kick), speed, reflexes, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance. His iron-like flesh can withstand Walter's wires (which can easily slice solid steel), even as they are tightened around his bare neck. He seems to be able to fall great distances without sustaining any damage. The Captain has some regenerative ability, as he quickly regenerated his mutilated hand in The Dawn. In addition to his natural abilities, the Captain possesses two modified Mauser C96s with incredibly long barrels, and a combat knife that he has not used yet.\\n\\nNote: His name is not Hans Günsche, this was a fanmade name for him because of a scene where various names appeared in the background and Hans was one of them.\\n\\nNo voice actors have been added to this character.

This is most expressed in his monologues which open and close each episode where he continues to claims that \"nothing amazing ever happens here\" despite the show\\'s surreal and often absurd happenings. Naota idolizes his older brother Tasuku, carrying around Tasuku\\'s baseball bat, and even hanging out with Tasuku\\'s old girlfriend Mamimi. In Naota\\'s mind, Tasuku is the epitome of what it means to be an adult, as opposed to the other adults in his life (e.g. his father, his grandfather, and his teacher) who he perceives as being immature. Much like Amarao, Naota is picky about his drinks (disliking drinks which are sour, bitter, or contain pulp) and hates spicy foods (note thought, he is told to \"cut back on the sour drinks\" by Amarao).'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Mamimi Samejima, 17, was Tasuku\\'s girlfriend, though she hits on Naota since his brother left Japan. She is a truant high school student with pyromaniacal tendencies; she also smokes a lot and spends most of her time under a bridge. She is often seen with a camera, and was once seen smoking worn cigarette with \"Never Knows Best\" written onto the paper.\\n\\nShe has the peculiar tendency to name people and things \"Ta-kun (Or sometimes simply spelled as Takkun),\" after her personal nickname for Naota\\'s brother (and Naota himself). The \"-kun\" suffix is an informal and intimate honorific primarily used when addressing males of equal or junior status. Mamimi is likely using Naota as a substitute for Tasuku and therefore refers to him as \"Ta-kun\" which can be short for both Naota and Tasuku. (Naota is well-aware of the similarity between his nickname and his brother\\'s name.) Mamimi also calls Tasuku \"Tasuku-sempai\" since he is an older classmate.\\n\\nThe story originally sets forth that her fascination with fire stems from Tasuku having rescued her from the elementary school fire, although it is later hinted that she was the one who started that fire. Mamimi holds an almost quixotically weak grip on the difference between fantasy and reality; for example, she believes Canti to be the manifestation of Cantido, the video game god to whom she burns things as sacrifices. She also emanates an aura of benign vapidness that causes much of the cast (Naota\\'s classmates especially) to look upon her with disdain and her peers to bully her. In fact, Mamimi can be exceedingly destructive—although only when nobody is watching. She spends much of FLCLimax exacting retribution against those who have wronged her—only to have her plan backfire.\\n\\nMamimi can be seen to lack control over her life or willpower, hence the near-constant smoking and child-like reliance on others, whether it\\'d be Naota or his older brother Tasuku. This could also explain why she loves taking care of things that are weak-willed, which she leaves (or which escape, like Ta-kun, the black kitten) when they start to show independence. This leads to her eventual disinterest in Naota and ultimately proves a disaster for her when her last adoptee, the terminal core from a robot, goes haywire and overpowers first her and then the military.\\n\\nAs far as high schoolers go, she seems to be rather sexually frustrated, as she often pursues an uncomfortable level of intimacy with Naota (most likely because she sees him as his brother\\'s replacement), which annoys Naota greatly. When he asks why she constantly clings to him, she responds \"If I don\\'t, I\\'ll overflow.\"\\n\\nMost characters refer to Mamimi simply as Mamimi, but Naota\\'s friends refer to her as \"Naota\\'s Wife\" and Haruko calls her \"Sameji,\" a shortening of her last name. Amarao refers to her as \"that high school girl.\"'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Lust is a Homunculus, nicknamed the \"Ultimate Spear\", and one of the first antagonists in the Fullmetal Alchemist series. She is the first Homunculus to appear in the series and plays a significant role in the plot of both the manga and 2003 anime series. Lust is also usually partnered with Gluttony to whom she appears to have a particular almost motherly closeness. Her Ouroboros mark is located on her collarbone, just above her breasts. \\n\\nIn the 2003 anime series;\\nLike her manga counterpart, she is highly intelligent, manipulative, and devoted to her own ideals; however, she begins to crave becoming a human as the series progresses. Her main purposes amongst the Homunculi are gathering information, and traveling to manipulate alchemists into creating Philosopher\\'s Stones. Gaining true humanity is the focal point of her ambition, arguably much more so than the rest of the Homunculi.\\n\\n\\nIn the manga and 2009 anime series;\\nLust is the only female Homunculus and the second to be created by Father. Due to her high intelligence and devotion to Father\\'s plan, Lust appears to have a great deal of free reign and authority within the organization, seeming to have a position second only to Pride and on par with Wrath. Lust also has a great disdain for humans, thinking them frail, predictable and generally stupid. Moreover, she appears to take pleasure in using and throwing them away. Lust is the first to introduce the idea of Homunculi as superhuman, the next wave of evolution of humanity, and takes pride in her nature.\\n\\n-Taken in part from Wikia.'}},\n",

To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the \"White Devil\" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.\\n\\nGintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV\\'s news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno\\'s dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.\\n\\nGintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a \"Bankai\" similar to the characters of Bleach.\\n\\nDespite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he\\'s barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.\\n\\nDespite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia, VS Battles Wiki, edited)'}},\n",

The Yato people are said to have \"transparent\" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan\\'s weapon of choice; Kagura\\'s is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.\\n\\nShe is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she\\'s often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.\\n\\nKagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.\\n\\nHer immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.\\n\\nShe came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki\\'s closet, like Doraemon.\\n\\nKagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki\\'s ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki\\'s bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with \"Gin-chan says...\" or \"Gin-chan told me...\"\\n\\nKagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn\\'t seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn\\'t display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura.\\n\\nShe regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that \"he definitely likes me,\" but as that hasn\\'t been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.\\n\\nAlthough Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her \"Anego\" (a term gangster women use to show respect).\\n\\nHer super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,\\' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to.\\n\\nAccording to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.\\n\\nIn Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.\\n\\n\\nIn the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in the 6th place.'}},\n",

Bulma is a direct parody of the character Xuanzang from the Chinese novel Journey to the West. Even though Bulma\\'s character parodies a monk, her Japanese name \"Buruma\" is the brand of a popular gym short worn by girls in Japan. Her re-adapted name Bulma is a direct take on the word \"bloomers,\" which was a popular brand of women\\'s underwear in the early 20th century.\\n\\nBulma is the second character to be introduced in the Dragon Ball series. In the early part of the story, she is the inventor of the Dragon Radar and is searching for the legendary Dragon Balls. Bulma was hoping to use the Dragon Balls to wish for the perfect boyfriend. While searching for a nearby Dragon Ball, she runs into Son Goku. It is at this time that she finds out Goku inherited one of the balls (the four-star ball) she is searching for from his Grandpa Gohan. Because of Goku\\'s love for the ball and his belief that his Grandpa\\'s spirit lives in the ball, Goku is not willing to give it up. Bulma then asks him to loan it for her in exchange of taking him in her travels. At that point, they team up to find the remainder of the balls and the adventure begins. In the later action-oriented episodes of the series, there is little room for a genius but Bulma continues to play a role as a secondary character, helping Goku and his friends with her gadgets, and having a rather rocky relationship with Yamcha.\\n\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia, Dragon Ball Super Exciting Guide, Character Edition)'}},\n",

       "   'about': \"Yasuna tends to be a quiet and often lonely girl compared to the rest of her friends. Since her parents are rarely around due to being overworked, she seems to depend on her close friends for love and support, especially when it comes to Hazumu, who unfortunately doesn't tend to show her the type of affection Yasuna desires from her. Yasuna and Hazumu first met as classmates, though they rarely ever talked with each other, which means that Hazumu was simply admiring Yasuna from afar.\\n\\nOne day when on Mt. Kashima sometime before the main story began, Yasuna found that they shared an interest in gardening. It was also at this point where she pointed out how feminine Hazumu appeared, which is also the main reason she could see most of his figure minus his face, which as a male was always shown with his hair covering it. As fate would have it, Yasuna rejected Hazumu's first confession of love for her as a boy, but later after his transformation into a girl, ironically she confesses her love to Hazumu.\\n\\nHer awkward personality and antisocial tendencies towards males in general is due to Yasuna displaying symptoms of androphobia. Astonishingly, she sees all men, minus Hazumu, as covered in a grey blur. This is mainly why she finds it easier to love Hazumu after he becomes a girl, showing much more blatant interest in Hazumu after the change.\\n\\nShe is in the Music Club and plays the flute. Incidentally, the music room where she practiced playing was positioned near a rooftop of the school where Hazumu would maintain a large garden.\"}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Guu\\'s stomach is a world, filled with buildings, hundred legged cats, and a nice young couple of lovers that have been trapped there for ages (but apparently don\\'t mind their predicament). Other than Hare, no character seems to be aware of Guu\\'s strange nature (or for that matter the bizarre circumstances surrounding everything else in the series). The weird events that occur because of her are only ever acknowledged by Hare. Everyone who is eaten by Guu, only to be spat out later (excluding Hare) dismisses what happened as \"sleeping\" (occasionally, dreaming about Guu\\'s Stomach world). Hare even dismisses his first time in Guu\\'s Stomach but is quickly proved wrong. There are other strange things Guu can do, which defy the laws of physics, logic, and reality, such as (but not limited to) superhuman strength, elongate her body parts, breathe underwater, teleport, time travel, cause people to switch bodies, read minds, cause disco music to play suddenly, switch her face (from a cute face to a weird face), transform into an older version of herself, transform into a giant kaiju monster version of herself, incite mental breakdowns in Hare, though the latter is more of a talent than an actual power and can connect anything to video game controllers and play around with it (even peoples minds). In one scene Guu hints towards being programmed to do what she does.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'When Vash\\'s bus runs across Wolfwood\\'s motorcycle in the middle of the desert. He proves to be a valuable ally although his and Vash\\'s philosophies often conflict, Wolfwood being a firm believer in martialism while Vash is a pacifist. By the end of the series, he agrees with Vash\\'s way of thinking even though it costs him dearly. Wolfwood\\'s purpose is to raise money for the children in the orphanage he runs.\\n\\nThe giant cross that he carries comes in two versions. Version 1 holds 12 pistols (across arms of the cross). Version 2 houses a giant machine gun (long part of the cross) and finally, a rocket launcher in the top, while the ammunition is stored in the arms of the cross(an alternate opinion is simply that one of the horizontal arms holds ammo for the machine gun and rocket launcher while the other holds six pistols). The trigger for the Version 2 is a skull shaped symbol in the centre of the cross. As can be expected, the weapon/case is very heavy, and only Wolfwood, Milly, and Vash seem to have no trouble holding it (though Vash once comments on its weight). The weapon is not actually named in the anime, but it is commonly referred to as Punisher, which comes from the manga. Wolfwood states that it\\'s heavy \"with God\\'s mercy,\" a fitting statement from the cynical Wolfwood.\\n\\nHe is modeled on Tortoise Matsumoto, the lead singer of the Japanese rock band Ulfuls. The name Wolfwood (ウルフウッド urufuddo) is a corruption of Ulfuls (ウルフルズ urufuruzu), which is in turn a corruption of the English word soulful (ソウルフル sōrufuru).\\n\\nNightow is frequently asked in interviews and at convention panels what the \"D.\" in Wolfwood\\'s name stands for. His responses have varied each time, ranging from \"Dangerous\" to \"Dokonokuminomonjawaresumakinishiteshizumetarokakora.\" The latter is actually stereotypical yakuza slang, and would be written out as \"どこの組の者じゃ、われ！？\\u3000簀巻きにして沈めたろか、こら！\", which roughly means \"What the hell family do you think you\\'re from!? I\\'m gonna tie you up in a reed mat and dunk ya!\". The common theme in these various expansions of the single letter \"D\" is one of destructive force, anger, or violence, which are traits Nightow has modeled the character after.\\n\\nIn the original Japanese version, Wolfwood speaks in a Kansai Dialect. Nightow has said of this: \"It\\'s an English-speaking world, so he\\'s not actually speaking Kansai dialect. Think of it as indicating some accent.\"\\n\\n\\n(Source: Answers.com, Wikipedia, Nicholas D. Wolfwood)'}},\n",

He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who\\'s listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in Zoro who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon \"Clima Tact.\"\\n\\nUsopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions. Also, Usopp has outstanding marksmanship abilities with his slingshot and is on his way to becoming one of the best snipers in the One Piece world, although his goal in life is to become a proud and strong pirate like his father Yasopp of the Red Haired Pirate Crew.'}},\n",

He has around half a dozen small bangs which he doesn't keep spiked. Instead of wearing the school-issued blue uniform of Sarayashiki Junior High, he wears a identically-designed green uniform. He does this in direct rebellion of the school's strict dress code. Throughout the series, Yuusuke's clothing changes, but he usually wears some type of fighter's garb. Yuusuke looks rather-skinny, a stark contrast to his unusual strength. At the beginning of the series, he was also quite short as seen when Keiko points out he was shorter than she was. \\n\\nHaving no father and with his mother always off somewhere else, getting drunk or partying, Yuusuke has grown up in a very neglectful environment. He's short tempered, impulsive, and likes to intimidate those who are afraid of him. One of his most notable traits is his desire to fight, which becomes more noticeable as the series progresses. Yuusuke has been noted on many occasions to being rather unintelligent and, at times, just plain stupid. Yuusuke's desire to fight is more out of enjoyment of a good brawl, and surprisingly Yuusuke doesn't like killing if he can avoid it.\\n\\nEven though Yuusuke is feared by most students; and severely disliked by almost all of the teachers, he is generally misunderstood. Keiko Yukimura is one of the very few who knows Yuusuke is actually very kind, and she sympathizes with his problems in life. Yuusuke and Keiko quickly develop strong feelings for each other; and he is fiercely protective of her, almost always worrying about her well-being. Yuusuke initially didn't like Kuwabara, but as the series progresses, the two develop a mutual bond and respect for each other, with Kuwabara being the only person who truly understands him. Yuusuke and Hiei have a serious rivalry and, at times, Yuusuke seems almost intimidated by Hiei's remarkable skills. Yet, each of them has respect for the other, and will put their lives on the line to help one another. Yuusuke is very close to Kurama and has a great amount of confidence in him. Yuusuke respects Kurama's wisdom, sometimes looking to him for leadership advice when he's not sure what to do.\"}},\n",

His analytical nature is present in battle where he prefers to study the strengths and weaknesses of his opponents before devising a strategy of his own.\\n\\nHe is protective of those he cares about and is often merciless to anyone that poses them a threat, a shift in his usually friendly manner. In many instances, Kurama has shown to be very self-sacrificing in the interests of the safety of his friends and family.\\n\\nYouko Kurama was a cold hearted and ruthless thief and the most feared bandit in Makai. He was considered to be an A-class demon (though he eventually surpasses that), and is said to be more than a thousand years old.\\n\\nAfter being wounded by a bounty hunter while in his spirit fox form, Kurama sent his spirit into the Ningenkai (human world) where his spirit took refuge within an unborn child that had not yet gained a soul. It was from this point that Kurama made the transfer to a human body with the intention to recover his strength as the child developed. Kurama planned to leave Ningenkai to return to Makai after regaining his strength after an estimated ten years. However, sometime during or before the tenth year, an act of selflessness by his mother, Minamino Shiori, opened Kurama's eyes to pain he had caused his mother while growing up. Thus, he decides to continue living his human life as Shiori's son.\\n\\nKurama's special ability is that he can turn plants into deadly weapons by manipulating his youki into that plant. Kurama has complete control over any Human Realm plant and has some control over Demon Realm plants. However Demon Fox Kurama has complete control over Demon Realm Plants and has more power than regular Kurama. The strength of Kurama's moves depends on how much aura Kurama uses. He has an incredible sense of smell and he can read lips. Though Kurama is considered the second weakest of the four main fighters, topping out at low S-class power by the end of the series, he is easily the smartest fighter of the four. He relies on cunning and tactics and not necessarily power to win battles.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)\"}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Belldandy is unflinchingly kind, patient, and warm, not only to Keiichi but to everyone, without exception. However, this does not mean that she is to be taken lightly; Belldandy is licensed as a goddess first-class, unlimited, and as such is highly skilled. Her power is so great, in fact, that she is required to wear a special earring on her left ear which constantly seals the full brunt of her magical strength. The only time at which she has ever revealed her true strength is during the Lord of Terror arc. At the end of this arc, Belldandy completely reconstructed their home from rubble, mentioning that doing so only took one ten-millionth of her power.\\n\\nBelldandy\\'s capacities and talents are diverse, whether magical or worldly. Not only can she change the appearance of her clothing and levitate (and, by extension, fly) as all full-fledged goddesses are expected to, but she can also teleport through mirrors, speak to and understand animals, \"see\" people\\'s emotions as auras, heal minor wounds by speeding metabolism, and \"speak\" to machines. Furthermore, she is a superb cook, and her singing skills are held to be the best in the heavens. She is also incapable of getting drunk on alcoholic drinks, but instead gets drunk with soda (it has to be noted, however, that she\\'s a complete lightweight in this regard. One sip is enough to send her in a drunken rampage—although given her personality, \"rampage\" takes an entirely different, but no less destructive, meaning). In addition, she is also the top broom racer in heaven, the only one that could rival her is Welsper from hell or Hild the Daimakaichou herself.\\n\\nBelldandy\\'s angel is Holy Bell (Bless餠Bell in some versions of the English manga); her elemental attribute is wind. Like all angels, Holy Bell augments Belldandy\\'s magical powers when called upon, and like all angels, she also reflects her master\\'s current state. For example, when Belldandy falls unconscious after being infected with a virus (in the movie), Holy Bell emerges comatose and covered with crystals that represent the virus.\\n\\nBelldandy does not appear to play a significant role in maintaining Yggdrasil. Rather, she works at the Goddess Relief Agency which deals with granting wishes (forming contracts) with humans, similar to Peorth\\'s work at the Earth Assistance Agency.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Leon is a French acrobat with a hard and cold character. He is recruited by Kalos to Kaleido Stage but his disgust of Sora Naegino almost makes him terminate his own contract very early on. However, after seeing Sora and May Wong fight on stage, he decides to remain in hopes that one of them can become his true partner. According to Layla, he\\'s so hard on his training and treatment of all partners that almost all of them end up injured and have to give up, earning him an horrible reputation among artists as well as the nickname \"God of Death\".\\n\\nLeon first chooses May, who becomes his partner in the work \"Dracula\" and again in the Circus Festival (which they win after performing the \"Demon Spiral\"). However, he realizes that the partner he truly wants and needs is Sora Naegino, who reminds him of his little sister Sophie, particularly in her dream: \"creating a stage with no competition where everyone will have fun.\" May had also become arrogant and self-centered, so he drops and injures her during an act, forcing May to re-evaluate her worth as a performer.\\n\\nThe introduction of his little sister Sophie reveals Leon\\'s stormy past. After their parents died, Leon and Sophie abandoned their abusive relatives and sought a trapeze coach named Alain, who took the siblings under his wing and discovered their potential, as well as how they invented put of scrap the Angelic Act. He subjected both of them to an amazingly hard training (especially Sophie, who was the one with the strongest will to perform the act), but at mid-way Leon felt that Alain couldn\\'t teach them anything and left with Sophie.\\n\\nDuring the last Circus Festival, Sophie was called by Yuri Killian asking her to meet him before the Festival at which she and Leon were two perform. However, this was a trap: Yuri never meant to meet with her, only wanting Sophie out of the way to cause the pair\\'s forfeit and solidify his win with Layla. Just before the Festival began, however, Sophie tried to come back in time, only to be hit by a car when running across the street; she died in the hospital, with a crushed Leon next to her. Just before she died, Leon called Yuri and tearfully asked him to visit Sophie, trying to deny the rumors about him being the culprit; Yuri, however, knew that he couldn\\'t just show up and didn\\'t.\\n\\nSophie\\'s death crushed Leon as he struggled with trying to fulfill his sister\\'s dying wish: find and raise the true star in Sophie\\'s place. For that, he subjects all of Sophie\\'s \"successors\" (including May and Sora) to the same training Sophie went through, which is the cause of his \"God of Death\" nickname. He eventually realizes, when he meets Sora, that she is the one who can become his partner, perform the Angel Act and become the true star.\\n\\nIn the final chapter, Leon is paired up with Sora in the work \"The Swan Lake\", and after helping Sora perform the act with her, not only fulfills Sophie\\'s wish, but also opens his heart to the idea of performing on a fun, conflict-free stage just like the one his sister dreamed of.\\n\\nIn the OVA The Amazing Princess Without a Smile, he tries to take up more comical roles on the Stage, playing one of the three Fools.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Birthday: June 20\\n\\nRoad Kamelot is the first Noah introduced in the D. Gray-man series, appearing to Allen, Lenalee, and Miranda in the Rewinding City arc. Despite looking as if she is in her early teens, Road is referred to as the oldest of the Noah. Road has an affinity for candies and blood, as well as a childlike enjoyment of birthday-reminiscent themes.\\n\\nRoad has a plethora of supernatural abilities, ranging from the ability to travel to an alternate dimension through a door that appears at her will to complete regeneration after injury. Her dimensional space is in the form of a wrapped present, while her weapons of choice are levitating candles that can be sharpened to waxen stakes. While inside her personal dimension, she can control nonliving objects within the area; For instance, her stake-like candles fly to attack at her will. She has absolute control of everything in her dimension ranging from her appearing out of the floor, creating a copy of Lavi to crumbling his Innocence. Outside of her dimension she has displayed Telekinetic powers.\\n\\nRoad\\'s personality and home life are surprisingly normal, despite her role as a villain. She has a childlike need to be entertained at all times, usually by the Earl\\'s parasol Lero, and forces Tyki to entertain her when Lero will not. She shows a tendency to procrastinate on schoolwork, like many children her age, and appears to be in trouble for skipping classes often. Despite her childlike tendencies, she has also shown signs of extreme sadism and seems to enjoy watching the suffering of others, including stabbing Allen through the eye, killing an Akuma subordinate for no other reason then to anger Allen, and nailing Miranda’s hands to a clock while writing profanity on the wall in her blood.\\n\\nHer relationships with the other members of the Noah family all vary on a basis quite similar to a normal family situation; She looks up to Tyki as an older brother and is very close to him, while the twins appear to bicker with her often in a sibling-like, affectionate manner. Her relationship with Skin is unknown, as almost no interaction between the two is shown in the series. She also seems to have feelings for Allen Walker, as she kisses him upon seeing him again. Tyki finds this surprising, as the only one she kissed before was the Earl.\\n\\nDespite Road\\'s young appearance, she is considered the First Child by Debit and Jasdero, which suggests that she was the first Noah to awaken in the current generation. Due to this fact, she is the only Noah capable of programming Noah\\'s Ark, and appears to have the favoritism of the Millennium Earl. She represents Noah\\'s \"Dreams\". Road\\'s nationality is unknown.'}},\n",

Before the start of the story, Sei\\'s appearance looked that of a person in his low twenties. Sometime in the past 10 years, he was reborn as a young child. Even though he was reborn into such a cute state (as Jirou puts it), Sei is serious and is one of the most powerful vampires in the story, which makes him highly respected. He could easily make a vampire uneasy with his powerful aura. He also has an older sister called the Dark Princess of the North.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Age: 15 (close to 16)\\nBirthday: May 8th\\nHeight: 165 cm\\nWeight: 58 kg\\nMother: Makiko Nagi\\nFather: Kago Souhaku\\n\\nSouichirou is a brash, blonde, spiky haired teenager, who enjoys fighting. As a child, Souichirou was bullied and tormented because his family consists of demon exorcists, and were not well liked as a result. The apartment he shared with his mom was also covered in offensive messages. Souichirou started fighting early as a result, beating up those who tormented him. In elementary school, he met up with his best friend Bob Makihara, and they started calling themselves the Knuckle Bombs. The pair go to school beating up everyone they find until they have been proven the strongest. Upon arriving at Todo Academy, Souichirou quickly learns he is nowhere near as strong as he thought.\\n\\nSouichirou fights using street fighting methods as opposed to real martial arts. He prides himself on being a thug and therefore he fights without honor, usually with cheap shots, etc... However, he does seem to draw line when it comes to hitting women. After training with Maya Natsume, he learns more martial arts moves including the Forged Needle attack. Throughout the Manga, it is shown that Souichirou and Aya Natsume have some sort of mental connection between them that calls to the other when they are in trouble.\\n\\nSouichirou is a teen obsessed with fighting and takes a lot of pride in that. Ironically, he believes that fighting doesn\\'t resolve anything, and fights more for fun than anything else. Initially, he is believed to have an average, or below average intelligence. He is very cocky and gets angered easily, and always has wise cracks. He isn\\'t very good with being around girls, because he had little contact with them up until high school because they thought he was creepy. When he enrolled into Todo Academy, he fought Masataka Takayanagi resulting in him losing his first major fight. He falls in love with Maya Natsume, because she is similar to him. Through out the series, he repeatedly has shown he has trouble showing any affection towards people he cares about. Souichirou is slowly changing, and starting to become more intelligent and starting to build the charisma of a leader. For example, Souichirou actually gets Kagesada Sugano (almost solely referred to by his nickname asshat in the manga or scum in the anime) to once again become an active Juken Club member. Their initial encounter seems to inspire Kagesada to quit his typical cowardly behavior and fight. Souichirou also occasionally breaks the fourth wall. The two most notable instances of this are in chapter 3 when he states that he\\'s supposed to be the \"hero,\" and in episode 24 of the anime when he refers to Masataka as a secondary character.\\n\\nAya is in love with him, but he seems uninterested because he is in love with Maya, although later on in the series he shows signs of liking or possibly loving her, not reacting so drastically when Aya shows her affections and trying to protect or comfort her (such as in chapter 109 when Souichirou, after Aya\\'s fight with Hirohiko, goes to check on her because he is worried about her even though he won\\'t admit it, which ends up in him receiving a kiss from her outside of the shower where they first met). Maya\\'s feelings for Souichirou are unknown. Later on, Shizuru Kamura, she also develops a crush on Souichirou and views Maya as an enemy as a result. Soichiro also seems to be rather protective of his mother, even though it doesn\\'t seem so initially. He plans to drop out and take over her work so she can finally retire after he competes in this years tournament.'}},\n",

Masataka is your average high school student at first glance, but he is a surprisingly powerful martial artist. He is always a formidable fighter, but he becomes much more dangerous when he is serious or angered. He actually is easygoing and somewhat shy; however, his inner nature is perverted, even though he dislikes this part of himself. Masataka falls in love with Aya Natsume at first sight, but is disheartened when she falls in love with Souichiro Nagi instead. He has maintained a crush on her, yet is oblivious to the other girls who have a crush on him. After the incident at the bowling alley, he is greeted by some blushing girls from Todo Academy, he is seemly ignorant of their intentions.\\n\\nAya describes him as the calm surface that gently envelops the rapids.\\n\\nMasataka is set up early as a great fighter, but is later ignored. At one point in the OVAs, Sōichirō refers to him as a supporting character. Despite being a great fighter, and one of the more powerful characters, Masataka is one of the most poorly treated characters. Because his elder brother is the president of the executive council, Masataka purposely joins the opposing Juken club.\\n\\nSoon after he meets Aya for the first time and falls in love with her, Masataka and Maya Natsume come across Bob Makihara and Souichirou. Bob is amazed someone can make Souichirou seem so helpless in a one on one fight, as Masataka beats up on Souichirou. Angered by this, Masataka says for the first time he actually feels like beating up Souichirou, and does another KI attack. Souichirou distracts him by using his \"barrier,\" where he shoves the unwanted bento Aya made for him in Masataka\\'s face. Masataka attacks Souichirou in a berserker rage who gives him a severe beating.\\n\\n\\nTechniques'}},\n",

He is the current unified WBC and WBA Middleweight champion and strongest known character in the series.\\n\\nTakamura is very hearty, rude and often behaves vulgarly. He is a loud arrogant boaster who tends to refer to himself as Ore-sama (a Japanese name suffix intended for people of great importance) and he rarely ever shows a shred of consideration towards other fighters after a loss.\\n\\nTakamura was discovered on the streets by Coach Kamogawa Genji, and his speed, power, and technique are all high-level to the point that he is capable of handling both In Fighters and Out Boxers without too much trouble. Unlike most characters in Hajime no Ippo, he has no special finishing blow, but every punch he has possesses killer destructive power. With the wild power to always force out any situation he claims will happen, he is a man who does everything he says he will.\\n\\nAs the one who got Ippo, Aoki and Kimura into boxing, he is well respected at the Kamogawa Gym. Even though he constantly looks down on and ridicules their achievements, his unrivalled strength and the few moments his true kindness leaks out prevent them from losing their respect for him. Takamura loves to pick on his fellow gym mates, with Aoki usually the first on his list. Although he tends to get more serious when hearing about or training for his next match, he still finds the time to play pranks on everyone and goof around.\\n\\nHe is the current WBC and WBA World Middleweight Champion and former WBC Junior Middleweight Champion. He was also the JBC Middleweight Champion, but relinquished it after 4 title defenses. He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his Belts. He still lives there even after becoming World Champion, preferring a simple life.\\n\\n\\nThe character for Taka (鷹) in his name means hawk, and as a result he is sometimes nicknamed The Japanese Hawk by announcers and spectators (most notably during his matches against Brian Hawk and David Eagle). His pompadour hairstyle is his trademark.\\n\\nCurrent Record:'}},\n",

Killing humans to drink their blood bothers her to the point that she refuses to continue to do so, though it leaves her in a weakened state. After Kai saves her from some thugs in Paris, Irène tells him how the Schiff came to exist, how they are dying from Thorn, and why they keep attacking Saya. She also tells him that they think Saya's blood will save them, so he offers to ask Saya. When the Schiff later attack Saya's group, she and Kai try to convince both sides to stop fighting because of their new friendship, but the fighting only stops when Irène collapses from her progressing Thorn. Saya reluctantly agrees to feed her some of her blood, but it ends up killing Irène. Her death is mourned by Kai, Saya, and the Schiff alike.

       "   'about': 'The story\\'s main antagonist. Also known as \"the Earl of Millennium.\" He tricks people with dead relatives and friends into creating Demons (Akuma). He is a sorcerer from long ago, and he plans to lead the world to its destruction. Sometime in the past he formed an alliance with the Noah Clan, who call him \"Duke Millennium\"(Except Road who calls him Millenie). Hoshino says she based the Earl of Millennium off a legendary alchemist/preacher (most likely the Count of St Germain or Nicolas Flamel, though in many ways he also reminiscent of Dorian Gray, possibly referenced in \"Dorian Grey man\" and thus \"D.Gray-Man,\" as adapted in the film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) whose tale even claims he still may be alive somewhere.\\n\\nIn appearance, the Earl resembles a grotesque caricature of a Victorian gentleman—a rotund figure in cape and top hat, with an enormous grin that remains fixed even when he is speaking and even eating, and his eyes permanently hidden behind a pair of pince-nez spectacles. In the manga, almost every one of his lines of dialog ends with a heart. In the anime, he invariably uses polite Japanese. Throughout the story, he displays two different personalities. The first is his normal cheerful, friendly, and happy attitude, almost like a friendly old uncle. With the Noah, he\\'s a member of the family, and is particularly playful and affectionate towards Road. His other personality is one of sheer, sadistic malice, capable of happily playing with people\\'s lives.\\n\\nHe wears a different hat in each encounter, each with a different decoration. In a gag comic in Volume 2 of the manga, he is shown taking off his hat, and having another set of ears. His main form of combat involves his umbrella Lero. He has also shown the ability to create massive explosions of dark energy. The Earl is also able to summon a large black sword that is the opposite of Allen\\'s Crown Clown sword.'}},\n",

But wanting to help people in need, Solomon went into the medical field and though he didn't directly participate in the war, he became a military doctor instead. However, because of what he witnessed during this time, the constant bloodshed of war terrified him and he wanted a war-free life.\\n\\nHe was introduced to Diva by Amshel in 1917 during the Russian Revolution. At this point he agrees to become a chevalier as he wanted to free himself from seeing humans kill each other, and hoped that peace would prevail. But afterwards, he started seeing humans as insignificant and beneath him. Though as time passed, he realized the world of the chiropterans is just as full of war as the human one. Because he was wearing white at the time, it is the only color that Solomon wears as it is a symbol of him being Diva's chevalier.\\n\\nSolomon is of French descent and one of the most charming characters in the series. Owning handsome attributes like a kind, gentle smile, he is shown to be the eye-catcher of every woman in any gathering. Retaining the appearance of a young man in his early to mid-20s, he has pale skin, light green eyes, and wavy pale blond hair. His ever smiling face displays his peaceful nature.

       "   'about': 'Kazuma is a rich, well known computer games programmer. He often helps to find information on his laptop computer, which he carries around with him all the time. At first after learning that he was a member of Class Q (which at the time was believed to be the lowest) he tried to get transferred in Class A. However, when his classmates came to his aid when he was in trouble he changed his mind, preferring to stay with his friends. Kazuma has a friendly rivalry with Kinta due to their different approaches to detective work. Kazuma and Kinta are often the butt of each others jokes. He is a very smart prodigy, but he can\\'t get right answers without his \"lucky\" hat as implied in episode 2; he seems to get over this flaw by the end of the TV series. (Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

Her most distinctive features are her very large breasts, which are even larger than Orihime Inoue's. She also shares Orihime's strange taste in food. She dresses in the garb typical of shinigami, though her robes hang loose enough for her ample bosom to be revealed. She wears a necklace and a pink scarf over her shoulders. In addition, her lieutenant's armband is worn on her uniform's sash, as opposed to around the arm.\\n\\nRangiku tends to be a slacker who doesn't like paperwork and loves to drink saké. She's not the least bit modest about her appearance, frequently referring or complaining about her large breasts in casual conversation. She even tries to bribe Ichigo Kurosaki into letting her stay at his house using them, though unsuccessfully. Her easy-going and free-spirited personality is in sharp contrast with the serious Hitsugaya, but the two seem to be quite close, regardless. Rangiku is almost constantly by his side and has shown her loyalty to him on several occasions. While she seems somewhat self-centered, she is sensitive to the feelings of others, evident when she sees the concern Hitsugaya has for Momo Hinamori, the guilt Izuru Kira shares with her when Gin Ichimaru is revealed as a traitor, and when Orihime feels depressed about her role in Ichigo Kurosaki's life. Despite her lackadaisical image, she can be extremely serious when needed. She's shown to be somewhat maternal, especially with Orihime and Momo.\\n\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia, Bleach Official Character Book Souls)\"}},\n",

District #80 is the worst, most lawless region of Rukongai, full of thieves and murderers (whereas area #1 is the most orderly and law-abiding). While residing in District #80, Kenpachi was nameless. During that time, he became proficient in swordsmanship and killed numerous enemies.\\n\\nAt some point during his travels outside of District #80, he found a small girl and named her Yachiru (八千流), in remembrance of the only person he ever admired, after she showed no fear of his sword. Yachiru came from area #79, Kusajishi (草鹿), where her parents were murdered. The two events were apparently quite close. On that day, he also took on a name: Kenpachi, the title bestowed upon the strongest swordsman, the one who has killed the most. The two developed a father-daughter-like relationship.\\n\\nAlso, at some point (before he became a Captain), he fought and defeated Ikkaku Madarame; for this reason, Ikkaku pledged to serve under Kenpachi from there on out (Ikkaku doesn\\'t actually get the chance to do so until he joins the 11th Division), but Ikkaku would still jump at the chance to fight Kenpachi to the death.\\n\\nAfter some time had passed, Kenpachi found his way to the Seireitei. He defeated and killed the previous Captain of the 11th Division (whose identity is currently unknown) and gained his seat in the Gotei 13 in this manner. In the anime, his assumption of the Captain\\'s seat caused Maki Ichinose to leave the Soul Society. According to the anime, it is also what convinced Ikkaku and Yumichika to join the Shinigami.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Ichigo\\'s zanpakutō is named Zangetsu (斬月 lit. cutting moon).  The spirit of Zangetsu resembles a 30 to 40 year-old man, and Ichigo calls him \"old man\" (おっさん ossan) as a result. Zangetsu has also been called the \"black-clothed man\" (黒衣の男 kokui no otoko). Zangetsu is portrayed as wise and calm in most matters, and fond of testing Ichigo in unusual ways, many of which have a purpose completely contrary to the stated goal. Zangetsu has displayed the ability to temporarily close fatal wounds during combat, though whether or not this is a unique ability is unclear. Unlike most zanpakuto, Zangetsu has no release command. The shikai form of Zangetsu resembles an over sized, though more elegant, cleaver blade without a hilt guard. The sword is as tall as Ichigo is, 1.74 meters, and has a black blade with a silver edge. When not in combat, the cloth extends to cover the rest of the sword and falls away when necessary, shrinking back to a manageable size. The cloth can also be used to swing the weapon like a flail and toss it at opponents, but this is rarely done. \\n\\nThe bankai of Zangetsu, named Tensa Zangetsu (天鎖斬月, lit. heavenly chained cutting moon), is considered completely out of the ordinary for any zanpakutō. Unlike most bankai forms, which usually create some sort of massive creature or effect, Ichigo\\'s bankai actually shrinks his sword down to a daitō (Japanese long sword) with a black blade, handguard in the shape of the manji (which is the kanji for \"ban,\" meaning \"full\"). The cloth wrapped around the hilt is replaced by a short chain with a broken link, similar to that of a plus spirit. In addition to his sword, Ichigo\\'s robe is replaced with a long-sleeved, ankle-length black coat with red lining that is closed at his chest, much like that of Zangetsu himself. \\n\\n\\nZangetsu\\'s special ability (in either form) is the getsuga tenshō (月牙天衝, lit. moon fang heaven stab, Viz: Moon-Fang Piercer of the Heavens), which fires concentrated energy blasts from the tip of the blade in the shape of a crescent moon. \\n\\n\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

He has a cunning, goal-oriented mind and does not seem to care what means he uses to accomplish those goals. His sense of morals is lax at best, but he is quick to find the moral flaws of others, which he keeps recorded in his \"Book of Threats\" or \"Devil\\'s Handbook,\" and uses this information to blackmail everyone from students to figures of authority into placing him in a position of power. He has little respect for authority and has in fact usurped authority over Deimon High School well before the series begins and know authority of a vice principal, using his power in the school to give himself beyond-perfect scores in all his classes and divert funds to the American football club as he desires. Besides blackmail, Hiruma can often intimidate others into taking the action he wants by waving around his vast arsenal of firearms. Even without having to take direct action, Hiruma\\'s mere reputation is enough in some instances to make the majority of the student body fear him and bow to his authority. \\n\\nDespite his penchant for blackmail and breaking seemingly every school rule without consequence, Hiruma adheres to the rules of American football without exception while playing. Inagaki says that Hiruma \"does everything else to win\" and is \"only concerned with winning.\" Instead, Hiruma attempts to throw opposing teams off guard through taunts and insults. Even when Hiruma expresses excitement or happiness, he does so in a violent manner, by firing his large guns into the air or kicking a teammate in the rear when they have executed well on a play. \\n\\nHe addresses all members of the Deimon Devil Bats with a vulgar manner, beginning with \"Fucking\" and ending with a descriptive noun, such as \"Shorty\" for Sena or \"Monkey\" for Monta. Some characters, such as Kid, have observed that Hiruma\\'s attitude and even aspects of his demonic appearance are an act to intimidate his opponents both on and off the field. Over time, the series has alluded to Hiruma\\'s \\'true\\' personality, which Sena and Mamori Anezaki have at times been shown to understand to some degree, as when one or the other correctly observes Hiruma to be worried, happy, or tired. In addition to these instances, Hiruma has shown compassion to others, though he continues to hide it with his demonic behavior —allowing Takami some privacy after a loss is one such instance. In addition, some of Hiruma\\'s actions imply that he cares for the other members of the team more than he lets on. \\n\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

Lala dislikes Ichijou\\'s name because her mother, who abandoned her and her father when she was a child, was also named Karen.\\n\\nShe detests the D-cup-hunting pervert Imadori, especially when he managed to grope her chest while being choked. She thus tends to beats him up whenever she sees him after sufficient provocation. Lala works in the same fast food restaurant as Ichijo, where no one dared to go to her counter because of her violent temper. She even grabs customers that annoy her and drags them inside for a beating. Lala\\'s closest friends appear to be Harry Mackenzie and Masakazu Tougou, who both look out for her. Later on, her animosity towards Ichijo softens. Her character is the direct opposite of her rival Ichijou, being that she is tall, well-endowed, sour-faced, hot-tempered, and very easily provoked.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

She is a two-year-old robot created by Satomi Hakase to serve Evangeline and protect her during time where the spell binding her weakens her. She is initially without any real emotions, but after spending time around Negi, she begins to have feelings for him, and show emotions, such as embarrassment when the crush is brought up, her internal gears increasing in speed during moments where a human's heart would beat faster, and even leaking laser fluid from her eyes when she's upset. These feelings go against her original programming, which excites Hakase. She spends most of her free time helping people and rescuing stray animals. She strongly fears the idea that she is nothing more than a soulless doll and that she does not have a soul; however, during the Governor's ball in the Magic world she forms a pactio with Negi (in Nagi form) which appears to have a cat theme, proving that she does indeed have a soul; as Pactio contracts can only be formed between those with true souls.\\n\\nChachamaru's body is powered by an internal spring combined with magic, and it has to be wound with a key by someone with magical energy to power her. The actual winding process is apparently pleasurable and/or arousing, although too much magic can intensify the feeling to uncomfortable levels. She is skilled in hand to hand combat, and she is equipped with rocket fists, laser emitters, magic-powered thrusters that can allow her to fly for fifteen minutes, and a tool to undo binding circles. Her body has been upgraded several times, and she is later given a completely new body that looks completely human, unlike her original body's easily detectable parts; she even has a chibi body designed to disguise herself. The upgrade also allows her to transform her arms into swords and guns.\"}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Student Number 31\\nBirthdate: March 17, 1989\\n\\nThe silent acrobat, and one of the most mysterious girls of the class. Nothing much is known about her, as she rarely associates with anybody, and even when she does, she rarely talks (she has spoken only eight times in the serialized manga thus far). What is known is that she is a member of the Nightmare Circus, the school\\'s Acrobatic Club, and is seen directing a group of \"monsters\" or \"spirits\" (similar to No-Face from Spirited Away, the Angels from Neon Genesis Evangelion or possibly Hollows from Bleach) when she offered to cover for her classmates during the school festival, and gave Chao a tiny living dragon as a farewell gift. She also has been shown to see Sayo without the assistance of Negi or having a close relationship with her like Kazumi. According to Negi\\'s Class Register, Zazie is also a member of the school\\'s Magic Club, though whether this is real magic or stage conjuring is unknown. In the anime, she is shown to have proficiency in all kinds of circus tricks such as juggling, sleight of hand, and costume changing. She has dark skin, and has two particular face marks: a large teardrop under her left eye (strongly resembling the carnival character \"pierro\"), and a vertical line resembling a scar crossing the right side of her face. A splash picture of the cast shows her with claws growing from her fingers. She is sometimes seen with her pet bird, but more recently with her \"friends\" (the black spirit-monsters). So far, she is the least known of all the students in Negi\\'s class and very little has been revealed about her.\\n\\nZazie is one of the few students in Class 3-A who did not participate in Negi\\'s sojourn to Wales and the Magical World.\\n\\nWhen Zazie\\'s name is seen it is written in the Latin alphabet, rather than in Japanese. Similarly, Evangeline\\'s name is also written with the Roman alphabet. This seems to indicate that, like Evangeline, Zazie isn\\'t from Japan and is instead from a country which uses the Roman alphabet. This is backed up by the fact that Chisame referred to her as a transfer student in volume 2.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

She first appears when she tries to kill Gene Starwind\\'s friend Fred Luo as part of her contract with a rival weapons seller. Gene is able to outsmart her and force her to consent to come after him before she kills Fred as part of her pride. However, in her next appearance, Suzuka saves Melfina from a Kei Pirate and decides to help the group against the Kei Pirates, mainly to go after a member of the Anten Seven named Hitoriga, who killed her family. Surprisingly, Suzuka seems to know more about the Kei Pirates than the rest of the crew. Among the various members on Gene’s ship, Suzuka could best be considered the lone wolf, relying very little on outside help to accomplish her goals and frequently disappearing at ports to take care of \"business.\" She is quiet and pensive, and once tells Gene that she \\'sticks around\\' only because she finds him interesting, much to his chagrin.\\n\\nMuch about Suzuka\\'s past is unknown, such as why the Kei pirates would target her family, how she survived, and who trained her or if she trained herself. Even her age is never really mentioned during the run of the series. All that is known is that her pursuit of the Kei Pirates is of personal nature, particularly towards the assassin Hitoraga, who murdered her clan and family. Near the ending of the series, it is implied that she has feelings for Gene. During her fight with Hitoriga, he asked her, \"Why are you following this man? Don\\'t tell me you love him.\" She responded by telling him that he would hear the answer if he defeated her, which ended with Suzuka being the winner.

Like Keitaro, she is a third-year ronin trying for Tokyo University. However, her reasons for failing are because of simple mistakes such as not putting her name on the test or succumbing to her anemia and fainting during the exam. In the manga and anime she, along with Naru, was a childhood friend of Keitaro with whom she promised to go to Tokyo U together. Mutsumi has an affinity for watermelons and turtles and gave a latter one, Tama-chan, to Keitarō and Naru as a gift. Mutsumi has eight brothers and sisters and has a striking resemblance to her mother. She is called the \"female version of Keitaro\" due to their shared clumsiness. When Kanako begins to run the Hinata house, Mutsumi disguises herself as Keitaro to test the girls on their hostess skills; the resemblance is so uncanny that momentarily even Naru is fooled.'}},\n",

She can often wreak great damage to boulders or other objects using nothing more than her wooden practice sword. Motoko is very terrified of her sister, Tsuruko, whose skill far exceeds her own, and has a phobia of turtles that is left unexplained for the majority of the series. She disapproves of Keitaro early on, on the basis of him being a letch and a weakling, but later develops a grudging respect and eventually a hidden affection for him (much to her chagrin). She is at first uncomfortable with her femininity, partially because her sister left her sword for a husband, partially because of her height: she is the tallest person in the house, 3 cm taller than Keitaro(171cm). She later becomes more open due to Keitaro\\'s influence. Whatever her feelings for Keitaro happen to be at a given time, she still frequently threatens or attacks him with her sword.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

The Zantetsuken is usually used to cut inanimate objects, which Goemon considers unworthy of his blade and often mutters his catchphrase \"once again, I have cut a worthless object\" after doing so. Objects cut by Zantetsuken will fall apart a couple of seconds after he sweeps through them with his blade.

       "   'about': \"Inspector Zenigata hails from Japan, city of origin unknown. According to Episode 0: First Contact, his original title was Tokyo Police Inspector whose original interest was the capture of Fujiko Mine and her then partner. His pursuit took him to New York where he met Arsene Lupin III for the first time. The master thief's cocky attitude and talents left the inspector infuriated to the point where he left the Japanese Police Force in favor of enlisting in ICPO (called Interpol in Pioneer's English dub) for the sake of specifically bringing Lupin to justice.\\n\\nZenigata has made it his life's mission to arrest Lupin. The other members of Lupin's gang are targeted for apprehension as well, but Zenigata usually ignores them when Lupin himself is present. Lupin and Zenigata appear to be the worst of enemies, but in the anime they are, in a manner of speaking, friends; something Lupin shows openly (often by greeting Zenigata with mock affection), but it is an idea Zenigata is extremely reluctant to entertain. Similarly, he is often awed by Lupin's genius, but refuses to show it. Also, when he believes Lupin to be dead, he will drop to his knees crying at the fact he couldn't arrest him before his death, and often go into isolation until someone reveals that Lupin is still very much alive. Zenigata has an attachment to Lupin with the belief that no one should kill him or worse, capture him, besides Zenigata himself. Once, when he believe Lupin was dead, he gave up his profession and became a monk (in Fuma Conspiracy). Lupin's opinion of Zenigata is a little less caring, but still filled with respect. He often seems amazed that Zenigata can keep up with him. At times he's overwhelmed by how much thought Zenigata has put into his traps for Lupin. Once, when Lupin thought Zenigata was dead, he sought to take down his supposed murderer.\\n\\nWhile he has some interest in capturing Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko, he is really after only Lupin. Jigen seems to have a genuine fear of being caught by Zenigata.\\n\\nIn The Mystery of Mamo (originally titled simply Lupin III), it is mentioned that Zenigata has a daughter named Toshiko, but this isn't developed any further. He's unable to settle down because of his eternal pursuit, and although he sometimes longs for female company he has no luck with women - in no small part due to his inability to commit himself to anything but chasing Lupin.\\n\\nThe anime version of Zenigata is a quite sensitive person and often cries in emotional situations, particularly when he thinks Lupin has done something out of consideration for him, or when finding out Lupin is OK after worrying about him. On occasions when Lupin appears to be dead, he mourns him more expressively than anyone else; partly from genuine grief, partly because he no longer has a goal in life. In the 1987 OVA The Fuma Conspiracy, Zenigata actually retires from police work when he believes Lupin has died and becomes a monk, believing that if he prays enough Lupin will be a law-abiding citizen in his next life. Because of this singular ambition, he is never particularly displeased when Lupin manages to escape his custody, since that means the hunt will go on. On one occasion when Zenigata is able to successfully capture Lupin and place him in prison he becomes frustrated that Lupin hasn't yet escaped after a year has passed and wishes for him to escape or be rescued by Jigen.\\n\\nZenigata even goes so far as to cryogenically freeze himself so that he can continue to chase Lupin in the future, though both his and Lupin's cryopods malfunction and they are stuck in the present.\\n\\nThe origin of Zenigata's and Lupin's mutual regard was based early in the series when Lupin had the chance to shoot the Inspector, but instead wished him well and escaped. Since then, an unwritten understanding between the pair has always been neither will attempt to cause the death of the other. Further, the two are best referred as unacknowledged friends; several occasions have occurred where Lupin and gang aided Zenigata out of a life-threatening situation; when a woman the Inspector loved was killed by a criminal gang, Lupin participated in avenging her murder. On another occasion when an old enemy of Lupin's shot Zenigata point blank, Lupin began a wild motorcycle chase to apprehend the killer, partly to conclude affairs with the adversary, and partly to avenge the (supposed) death of the Inspector.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)\"}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Suigintou is the first doll of the Rozen Maiden collection. Her desire to win the Alice Game is the strongest of all the dolls, and is primarily driven by her wish to gain the attention of \"Father\" (Rozen). Sadistic, spiteful, and arrogant (all due to her spectacular Superiority complex), Suigintou has no inhibitions when it comes to the Alice Game. She will use any method available to her, regardless of how brutal they may be, to grasp victory. Although she generally avoids associating with the other dolls on a social level, she has a particularly strong hate for Shinku. This hate borders on obsession, as she can approximate how many hours and minutes since they have last met. However, upon meeting Megu, her medium, Suigintou\\'s attitude and motivations begin to shift; she begins to feel a strong affection for someone other than \"Father\". Suigintou\\'s desire to protect Megu begins to even overpower her wish to meet him: she hopes to use the collected Rosa Mystica to heal Megu of her heart ailment, rather than become Alice.\\n\\nSuigintou has a number of unique traits and flaws amongst the seven Rozen Maiden. In the anime, she is missing her torso; Shinku explains at one point that before Suigintou was completed, her design was erased, but gives no further explanation as to why or how. Curiously, after Suigintou is destroyed in battle by Shinku partly she is restored mid-way through Rozen Maiden Träumend. The identity of the person responsible for her restoration is never revealed. In the Rozen Maiden Träumend finale, she tells Shinku that \"Father\" had told her that even with her flawed body, she was also entitled to a part in the Alice Game. Later, Rozen is seen lovingly fixing her neck ribbon as she is unconscious. He even grips gently around the waist afterwards, implying that he has mended her incomplete body.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlong with her artificial spirit, Meimei, Suigintou\\'s weapons are her ragged black wings. With their arrow-like feathers, she can conjure up a shield, a large sword, or even twin black dragons. Suigintou can also create destructive blue flames as a last resort in battle. The variety in Suigintou\\'s abilities, particularly when combined with her savagely cunning nature, makes her a strong player in the Alice Game.\\n\\nMedium: None (First Season)/Megu (Second Season)\\n\\nSuigintou\\'s name in English means, \"Mercury Lamp\".'}},\n",

Ulquiora is the 4th ranked espada.\\n\\nUlquiorra is also analytical; during his and Yammy\\'s first visit to the human world, he makes several remarks on the humans who confront them. He theorizes that Orihime Inoue\\'s healing power is a temporal-spatial ability, which Aizen describes as the rejection of fate, and comments on how Ichigo Kurosaki\\'s final release can easily get through Yammy\\'s defenses. He also notes Ichigo\\'s power fluctuation, which varies between very weak and stronger than his own.\\n\\nIt would appear that Ulquiorra and Grimmjow, the 6th Espada, are not on good terms. While Ulquiorra allowed Yammy to kill anyone he deemed as \"trash,\" which included Ichigo, Ulquiorra allowed him to live based on his belief that Ichigo\\'s power was so turbulent that eventually he would destroy himself. Grimmjow\\'s conflicting viewpoint was that Ichigo should have been destroyed outright, as he could overcome his weakness and grow even stronger. Despite Grimmjow\\'s argument, Aizen trusted Ulquiorra\\'s judgment. This disagreement led to Grimmjow\\'s unauthorized assault on the real world. Though Ulquiorra is of a higher rank than Grimmjow, Grimmjow is confident that Ulquiorra is afraid to fight him for fear of them destroying one another.\\n\\nWhen released his zanpakutou, Murciélago (Japanese for \"giant black-winged demon,\" Spanish for \"bat\"), creates two large black wings on his back. His hollow helmet centers atop his head, sporting two large horns, and his arrancar uniform appears more form fitting at the top, becoming robe-like towards the bottom. Additionally, Ulquiorra is apparently unique among the Espada in that he has a second release; Resurrección Segunda Etapa (Spanish for \"resurrection second stage\"). He becomes more muscular with clawed hands and feet, the whites of his eyes turn black, and his helmet is replaced with elongated horns. He loses his clothes; his arms and legs from the hip down are covered in black fur, and he gains a long thin tail. In both forms he can create long \"lances\" of energy called Lanza del Relámpago ,ransa deru reranpāgo?, Japanese and Spanish for \"lance of the lightning\"), and when thrown can cause an explosion. Ulquiorra seems unfamiliar with the technique when he uses it in his second release state, unexpectedly missing Ichigo with his first one, however, to compensate, he can produce more should his first miss the target.\\n\\nTheme song: \"Moonshield,\" on the album \"The Jester Race\" by the group \"In Flames.\"\\n\\n(Source: Bleach character books I-III)'}},\n",

The humorously cruel treatment he is always subjected to provides the comic relief in Bleach. One of the only people who gives him any respect is Chad; however, Chad ignores him most of the time. His plushie body is a knock-off of the main character of the popular TV show Carnivore Kingdom, named \"Ponkichi,\" which happens to be Chad\\'s favorite show. It was a prize from the shooting game in the Karakura Town Festival. He is constantly stepped on and torn, at which point Ichigo will have Uryū Ishida repair the plushie. Uryū usually adds something unwanted or unnecessary when doing so, such as dressing Kon up like a designer doll. Uryū also sewed a Quincy cross on the back of Kon\\'s head as revenge after Kon attacked Uryū for turning him into a doll.\\n\\nKon is quite perverted and often takes advantage of his form to get girls to hug him to their chests, which rarely goes as planned. After Ichigo becomes less dependent on Kon to transform, Kon comments on how he wouldn\\'t mind taking Ichigo\\'s body out for a spin again, saying that he\\'d like go peeping and pulling up skirts because, as he puts it, \"It\\'s [Ichigo\\'s] reputation that gets sullied.\" Kon is very fond of Rukia, calling her \"sister,\" though this extends to basically any pretty girl.\\n\\nKon is a special type of soul pill called a \"modified soul\" or \"ModSoul.\" When inserted into a body, an aspect of the body is made superhuman, which in Kon\\'s case is enhanced speed and strength. Because of the shady origins of the ModSoul, the soul society called for the destruction of all ModSoul pills, but luckily, Kon was shipped out with a load of regular soul pills by mistake. This gives rise to his belief that everyone should be given a chance at life and should not be killed merely based on the circumstances of their origins.\\n\\nHis name \"Kon\", which was given to him by Ichigo, comes from the word \"Konpaku\" within the term \"Kaizou Konpaku,\" the Japanese name for \"modified soul.\" Kon wanted his name to be \"Kai\" from \"Kaizou\" because it sounded cooler, with which Ichigo agreed, but at the same time refused to name him that so as to not give him any satisfaction.\\n\\nTheme songs: \"Nichiyoubi Dansu\" by Kuuki Koudan (Kon Theme #1) and \"Bushman\" by Rip Slyme (Kon Theme #2)'}},\n",

Hinamori is generally quite trusting, but also very impulsive and naïve. She greatly admires her former captain, Sōsuke Aizen, whom she became a shinigami just to serve under, and Hinamori refuses believing that Aizen intentionally betrayed Soul Society. Her appearance is fairly ordinary compared to other shinigami in Soul Society. She wears her hair up in a bun with a cloth wrapped around it. According to Tite Kubo, Hinamori\\'s name was changed at the last minute; she had a completely different name in the sketch stage.\\n\\nHinamori grew up in Junrinan, District 1 of Rukongai, along with Tōshirō Hitsugaya. While Hitsugaya tended to be a bit of a brat as a child and insisted that he would protect her, Hinamori found him amusing and treated him in an older sisterly fashion, and the two became close friends, with Hinamori giving him the nickname Shiro-chan (little Shiro in English Anime). When Hinamori entered the shinigami academy, she excelled at kidō. It was there that she met Kira and Renji, who soon became her friends and, later, her fellow lieutenants. They were placed in the 5th Division of the Gotei 13 under Captain Aizen and his lieutenant, Gin Ichimaru. While Kira and Renji would later leave to other Divisions, Hinamori remained in the 5th Division and became the division\\'s lieutenant (through much hard work, as noted by Hitsugaya).\\n\\nHinamori\\'s zanpakutō is Tobiume (飛梅, lit. flying plum tree).

       "   'about': 'The fourth Rozen Maiden doll, and Suiseiseki\\'s tomboyish twin sister. As with Suiseiseki, she is a gardener that has the power to enter human dreams, and carries a set of pruning shears that she uses to tend humans\\' soul trees. She wields these in battle combined with acrobatic flight, her spirit Lempika and her hat which can be thrown and returns like a boomerang, a tactic she used to temporarily disarm Shinku in their second fight. She also has heterochromatic eyes like Suiseiseki, but the colors are the mirror image of her sister\\'s. Her personality is also the polar opposite of Suiseiseki; she is rational, calm, quiet and deeply devoted to her master and to her duties, including the Alice Game. She possesses a sharpness in her speech that is similar to Shinku\\'s, attacks ruthlessly in combat, and does not tolerate sub-par actions. Her appearance is not only the most masculine of the dolls, but her speech is also noted to be of the masculine form, using the first person pronoun \"boku\" instead of gender neutral pronouns like \"jibun\" or \"watashi.\" Souseiseki\\'s presence is much more significant in the anime than in the manga.\\n\\nIn the manga, her master wanted to use Souseiseki\\'s power to enter other people\\'s dreams and exact revenge on his brother\\'s lover, who he felt had stolen his brother from him. Since Souseiseki alone could not achieve this goal, she fights Suiseiseki to gather the two gardeners\\' tools, the shears of the Gardener and the watering can of the Gardener, which together can affect an individual\\'s soul tree. She eventually realizes that it is her master\\'s heart that needs to be freed and sacrifices herself to do. \\n\\n\\nIn the anime, Souseiseki is devoted to a lonesome old man, who uses her as a substitute for his deceased son, Kazuki. She is shown to be slightly more eager, probably from a sense of duty, to participate in the Alice Game than her sisters. In the OVA, she is introduced in the flashback in mid-fight with Shinku and later does not hold back in attacking a then-harmless Suigintou. Throughout Rozen Maiden träumend, she questions her idyllic lifestyle, and much to Suiseiseki\\'s disappointment, takes part in the Alice Game out of devotion to Rozen, to fulfill his wish of finding Alice and relieve his perceived grief. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHer artificial spirit is named for a fragrance by Lolita Lempicka. Souseiseki was also the first runner-up for Saimoe 2005.\\n\\nMedium: Shibasaki Motoharu (Anime) / Yuibishi Kazuha (Manga)/Jun Sakurada (alternate dimension, manga)/ Jun Sakurada (real one.

Shiho Munakata calls him her older brother even though they are not related by blood. He works with the Student Council doing odd jobs for them (prompting Mai to label him a \"lackey\") and sits next to Mai in class.\\n\\nYuuichi used to be a member of the Fuuka kendo club and regularly made it into the nationals until he was suffered a severe injury to his knee at some point in the past, though the exact circumstances and nature of the injury are never explained in the anime. Masashi Takeda of the kendo club is seen looking sadly at Yuuichi\\'s name card on the wall of the kendo dojo at one point during the anime. Disenchanted, after his injury Yuuchi became a feared delinquent, but Shiho manages to convince him give up his antisocial ways.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the manga, Yuuichi is the protagonist and the one who is the transfer student rather than Mai. He finds out that he is the Key to both Mai and Natsuki, two well-known rivals at the school, exasperating and intensifying their mutual antipathy. Because of his dual Key status, he is often referred to as a \\'Perverted Beast\\' by his classmates. His relationship with Mai is much like the one in the anime, although there are further complications. i.e., Natsuki.\\n\\nYuuichi was forcefully dismissed from his former school\\'s kendo club after he attempted to stop the sexual assault of Shiho, costing his team the championships because of their disqualification. During the assault, one of the roughnecks pulled a knife out, and gave him a long gash proceeding from his elbow down to his wrist on his left arm. He is extremely sensitive about it, and it is the reason he refuses to join Fuka\\'s club despite team captain Takeda\\'s insistence.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Birthday: March 30\\nZodiac sign: Aries\\nHeight: 174 cm (5\\'8½\")\\nWeight: 54kg (119 lbs)\\nOccupation: 12th Division Captain, Vice-President of the Shinigami Research and Development Institute\\n\\nMayuri Kurotsuchi is Captain of the 12th Division in the Gotei 13 and 2nd president of the Shinigami Research Institute. He gained his position after Kisuke Urahara, the former captain and president, was sentenced into exile by Soul Society. His lieutenant is Nemu Kurotsuchi, his artificially-created \"daughter.\"\\n\\nMayuri\\'s appearance has a very skeletal look to it with a skull-like visage. His fingernails are blue and, with the exception of the fingernail on his right middle finger, are all short. The one long fingernail is as long as the finger itself. In the anime, Mayuri is revealed to have blue hair and yellow eyes when unmasked. He also wears a white hat with two ends that point to his right and a large purple scarf around his neck. He repaints his make-up every morning, as he always removes it before going to bed.\\n\\nMayuri\\'s left arm can extend out like a grappling hook. Mayuri is able to pull out part of his ear, which is Scythe like weapon attached to his body. He is able to blend himself with the environment with some sort of covering that flakes away once he reveals himself.\\n\\nMayuri Kurotsuchi is a researcher and personifies the stereotype of the mad scientist. By his early actions during the Ryoka Invasion, he is displayed as one of the most sadistic and cruel Shinigami. He sees everyone and everything not as a living being, but as an object to be researched—including himself. He has little respect or regard for most others, and was even willing to turn his own men (who were not aware of his plans) into human bombs in an attempt to capture Uryū Ishida and Orihime Inoue for experimentation. He also withheld vital information about the Bount from the other Shinigami in order to capture one as a research subject for himself.\\n\\nIt is known that Mayuri\\'s favorite food is pike fish, while he does not like onion. One of his free-time activities is reading every character published in Seiretei Communication. He himself publishes a serialization in the journal, titled \"Effective Medication for the Brain,\" which apparently contains detailed instructions on preparation of medicine and their application. Surprisingly it is highly popular among the readers.\\n\\nIn battle Mayuri likes to play with his opponent torturing little by little until they can hardly stand.\\n\\n\\nMaster Scientist/Inventor: As the head of the Shinigami Research Institute, Mayuri is a talented inventor and scientist, having created a number of devices or techniques to aid him in battle or otherwise. As well Mayuri is a mad scientist embodied, he has no morals or empathy in everyday life and apparently his work is devoid of it as well, he will go to any length he feels is necessary to achieve his goals. He often takes no interest in issues of Soul Society and will rather engage in his research, unless personally requested by the General Yamamoto.\\n\\nMaster Strategist: Mayuri has a talent for being well prepared. He takes various precautions before engaging in personal combat with an adversary, usually studying them through his various methods in order to gain a clear advantage. He seems to always have a contingency plan if something doesn\\'t work out the way he expects.\\n\\nBody Modification: It is implied that Mayuri has done extensive research on modifying bodies, and he has upgraded a variety of his own body parts to function as weapons or otherwise provide him with useful abilities. His left arm can extend like a grappling hook, and he is able to pull part of his ear out of his head to form a scythe attached to a rope-like ligament for use as a kusarigama. He can also blend into his environment with the aid of a topical camouflage which flakes away after he reveals himself. More impressively, he has demonstrated the ability to replace functional internal organs with false ones, a feat he performs on himself and his lieutenant to safeguard them from injury. This particular operation is conceived of and carried out in the span of less than an hour.\\n\\nMaster Chemist: Mayuri has otherwise been shown to be an adept chemist, manufacturing a drug that can slow down a person\\'s perception of time. It is able to make one second seem like 100 years for the unfortunate victim to whom it is administered. An undiluted dose of the drug causes the senses to speed up trillions of times while the relatively \"slow\" body fails to keep up, resulting in paralysis; on the other hand, it is implied that a diluted dose of the drug can greatly enhance the user\\'s reaction speed. Mayuri has also developed a \"regenerative serum,\" which can regrow limbs upon injection.\\n\\nEnvironment Melding Technique: Another one of Mayuri\\'s abilities likely achieved scientifically is his ability to meld with the color and texture of the environment.\\n\\nZanpaktou:\\nAshisogi Jizō (疋殺地蔵; Leg-Cutting Jizō): Ksitigarbha is a bodhisattva that watches over children and the underworld. In Japan, where he is known as Jizō, he looks rather like a baby dressed as a Buddhist monk; Mayuri\\'s Zanpakutō has what looks like a giant baby\\'s head on it. Its hilt is wrapped in cloth, and has several spiky protrusions sticking out right below the blade, which appear to resemble leaves. Unlike most Shinigami, his Zanpakutō\\'s sheath hangs directly in front of him, instead of to his side as they are commonly worn.\\n\\nShikai\\n\\nShikai Special Ability:\\n\\nBankai\\n\\nMayuri\\'s Bankai, Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō\\nMayuri\\'s Bankai, Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō\\n\\nBankai Special Ability:\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

Noda is, at the start of the series, a twenty-year-old free-spirited second-year music student. She is depicted as a complete slob: her cooking and cleaning skills are atrocious to the point of having mushrooms growing on her clothes and poisoning anyone who dares to eat her food (yet she\\'s never been poisoned). However she is an incredibly talented pianist who primarily plays by ear, in a cantabile style. In love with Chiaki, she follows him around constantly, claiming to be his \"wife,\" and leans on him to help her get through sticky situations. She sometimes compulsively needs to play the piano, neglecting everything in order to do it. As well as that, she seems to enjoy childish manga and movies. She is constantly hungry, and is fed dinners by Chiaki; she also steals many lunches from her fellow friend, Maki. Nodame has a tendency to speak cryptically (sometimes she doesn\\'t even understand herself), often refers to herself in the third person and uses nonsense words like mukya and gyabo.\\n\\nNodame is initially very dependent on Chiaki in terms of ambition - she has little intention of becoming a professional pianist, despite her remarkable talent, and wants to become a kindergarten teacher, though many feel she is too reckless and lacks the appropriate sensibility to be responsible with teaching children. Her piano style is considered to be completely haphazard, diverting from original intent at both dynamics, rhythms and even themes. Realizing that her current attitude towards music will eventually drive her apart from Chiaki, Nodame gradually develops the necessary drive to pursue music for her own sake. Her attitude towards music is largely due to an incident in the past where she was hurt by a teacher who demanded her to play music \"as it\\'s written.\"\\n\\nNodame\\'s character is based on a real-life counterpart with same name.'}},\n",

It is unknown what she and her gang, the Stripes, do on the street but it appears to be for the cause of good. Her life goal is to find a rich man and live comfortably. Unfortunately, that path is postponed when Nao is chosen to become the 4th Column alongside Natsuki and Shizuru. Her Meister GEM is the Wired Spinel and her element is a giant claw.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

She is cheerful and optimistic, but lacks the sophistication and \"common sense\" to deal with the royalty (due to her being a country bumpkin).

Taken to the Blitz Team\\'s base, Bit discovers that he is the only person capable of piloting the rare Liger Zero owned by the team\\'s manager. Over the course of the series, it is learned that the Liger Zero is one of a series of unique Ultimate X zoids, equipped with an Integrated Organoid system (also called Black Box) and possessed with basic intelligence. Some fans believe that the Integrated Organoid system of the Liger Zero resulted in a fusion of the Blade Liger and the Organoid Zeke, but this theory has not been confirmed on any official source, and is most likely false.Bit Cloud\\'s first name is believed to be derived of the Japanese term \"Bitto Shiyo-ze\" or \"Cheer up\", representing his happy-go-lucky personality. Bit has a strong relationship with the Liger Zero, treating the Zoid as a friend instead of just a machine. He is often seen in friendly conflict with Leena Toros, arguing over trivial matters like cookies, doughnuts, and the shower schedule. (Wikipedia)'}},\n",

He is a very faithful subordinate to Keroro. \\n\\nTamama is possessed of a tendency to have mood swings that border on a split personality, just like his partner Momoka Nishizawa. While usually gentle and cheerful, Tamama can become a vengeful, raving maniac at the drop of a hat[1]. This change is usually accompanied by the sound of a balloon popping.\\n\\nTamama is also prone to fits of jealousy, usually towards anyone who gets near Keroro (especially Angol Mois, who he frequently refers to as \"that woman\"). \\n\\nTamama likes junk food (especially candy, cake, cola, and potato chips) and physical training (he has his own private training room in the Nishizawa Mansion). In the anime, Tamama is diagnosed with high blood sugar because of his love of sweets, as revealed with a physical checkup.\\n\\nTamama\\'s least favorite sound is nails on a chalkboard.

       "   'about': 'Lance Corporal Dororo (Formerly known as Zeroro) is the Keroro Platoon\\'s assassin who crash landed on Pekopon and was forgotten about by his platoonmates (as usual.). Soon after, he found his leg caught in a bear trap and awaited his lonely death, until he was rescued by female ninja Koyuki Azumaya (With the help of Zeroyasha, the dog, in the anime). He decided to follow the way of the ninja, he changed his name to Dororo, the name of the forest where Koyuki rescued him. Dororo is often forgotten about by the rest of the platoon and most everyone else but Koyuki, which will cause his Trauma Switch to turn on. When this happens, a purple, gloomy era radiates from Dororo and he will sit in a corner or dark space and cry. His Trauma switch is usually activated when he is reminded of something done to him by Keroro during thier childhood, Such as using him as a sheild in a snowball fight caused him to remember when he was used in the same way during a dodgeball game. \\n\\nDororo has a love for all creatures and nature of Pekopon. He has stated that he has \"fallen deeply in love\" with the planet (Episode 13). As a result, he will not participate in plans that will potentially harm people\\'s feeling or nature, or endanger any wildlife species on the planet. Dororo has vowed to protect Pekopon at all costs along with Koyuki. \\n\\nAs a child, Zeroro loved to garden, which he still does. Dororo even has his own lovely garden in the underground base of the platoon, where he grows both plant species that are native to Pekopon and other alien planets. He uses gardening as a way of meditating (along with reading and actual meditating, usually ontop of high places like liamp posts or trees) to train his physical and mental swiftness. \\n\\nYoung Zeroro was part of a large, wealthy family. Unfourtunately, Dororo has never had a strong aura of presense, much to the point where people won\\'t notice he\\'s there even if he\\'s standing right next to them. Thus, little Zeroro never had many friends until Keroro and Giroro came along. Zeroro would do most anything to stay friends with the two, even when they (mostly Keroro) would often to things that led to his feelings being hurt or his possesions broken, and occasionally physically hurt. Over the years, Keroro has broken Zeroro\\'s precious music box, used his stamp collection, stolen the strawberries of Zeroro\\'s cake, wrote all over his books and taken advantage of his kind nature. \\n\\nDespite his mistreatment, Zeroro retained his sweet, humble and kind personality and doesn\\'t hold a grudge or want revenge against Keroro (unlike his counterpart in the Garuru platoon, Zoruru), though he will break down and cry when reminded of one of his experiences as a child. Dororo used his natural quietness and ability to be unoticed in the form of stealth after inspired (ironically) by Keroro to become an assassin in the Keronian Military. He joined an elite group of assassins along with Zoruru, led by Jirara, before departing for Pekopon as a Lance Corporal (In the manga, formerly a Private Second Class).\\n\\nDororo often ends his speech with \"De Gozaru\", an archaic form of \"Desu\". Also, Dororo adressed himself as \"Sessha\", an archaic male form of \"I\" primarily used by Samurai.\\n\\nEarly in the series, one of Dororo\\'s more common actions was to speak to Keroro and the others in the form of a shuriken made of paper which acted as a note, when needed. The shuriken would always seem to stick itself in Keroro\\'s head, usually causing him to freak out until it\\'s removed by another platoonmate. Dororo does not need to be close by to perform this.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Once a professor of meta-biology at Kyoto University, Kohzou Fuyutsuki is now Deputy Commander of NERV under Gendo. But he is not a military man, despite his professional bearing and seeming ease of command. In the director\\'s cut, it is revealed that he has had some sort of training as a physician though he has either lost or never acquired a license to practice medicine. There is no indication given during the series of any romantic relationships or of any dependents. In the episode The Birth of NERV, in several flashbacks, a few of his students and the superior professor at his institute (who first suggests that he take on the young and brilliant Yui Ikari as a research assistant) suggest that he be more sociable; this hints at Fuyutsuki being a classically withdrawn academic, and possibly a life-long bachelor. Shortly after beginning his academic (and platonically affectionate and supportive) association with Yui Ikari, he was directed by his institution\\'s superiors to initiate a similar arrangement with the then Gendo Rokoboungi.\\n\\nGiven later revelations about apparent decades-long behind-the-scenes machinations of SEELE into all aspects of the sciences directly and indirectly involved in the subject of Instrumentality (the Dead Sea Scrolls were uncovered in 1947, so presumably the world-wide conspiracy behind SEELE\\'s operations had been in existence for only slightly less time) it is safe to say that Professor Fuyutsuki had been monitored by and targeted for recruitment by SEELE early in his career. If speculations regarding Yui actually having been a junior member of SEELE through her father\\'s influence are correct, then Fuyutsuki\\'s association with Gendo Rokoboungi/Ikari was equally planned well in advance. His earlier introduction to Rokoboungi/Ikari by taking him on as a research assistant, bailing him out of jail, and later meeting him again after Second Impact during a research expedition to the area formerly occupied by Antarctica may be seen as steps in a testing procedure to determine his reliability, discretion and intelligence at being able to surmise SEELE\\'s goals...and whether he would actually be amenable to that recruitment.\\n\\nFuyutsuki\\'s earlier assessment of Gendo Ikari\\'s personality (in the Director\\'s Cut, the subtitle during Fuyutsuki\\'s recall of the initial meeting at the police station refers to Rokoboungi/Ikari as \\'real bastard\\') was reinforced by the Antarctic mission, during which Fuyutsuki began to suspect that the now Gendo Ikari\\'s associates in SEELE may be more powerful and dangerous than he originally realized. The seed of doubt planted during that voyage led to the discovery of the true nature of the events leading up to Second Impact and SEELE\\'s involvement in initiating that catastrophe.\\n\\nAfter Fuyutsuki threatened to expose Gendo to the public, regarding the massive deception concerning Second Impact, in 2003 (through his own research), Gendo Ikari led him into the GeoFront and Central Dogma and revealed to him an incomplete prototype Eva. At that point, Ikari asked Fuyutsuki to join him and \"create a new future for humankind, together with me.\" Fuyutsuki accepted this, and started to help Gendo. Whether this agreement was entirely out of idealism or more from self-preservation is not made clear. In the movie The End of Evangelion it is mentioned that SEELE had threatened Fuyutsuki with being \\'disappeared\\'; the implication is that this recruitment may have been a Hobson\\'s Choice.\\n\\nDespite Fuyutsuki\\'s initial dislike of Gendo, it is clearly evident that he becomes the closest thing that Gendo has to a confidant in the series. In many episodes, Fuyutsuki may be seen as a sort of external conscience for Gendo Ikari; despite his somewhat gruff nature, Fuyutsuki is genuinely concerned for those under his commend, but having the added knowledge of SEELE\\'s true goals for Instrumentality, must balance his compassion with Ikari\\'s ruthlessness in pursuing both SEELE\\'s agenda and Ikari\\'s own hidden one of re-uniting with his discarnate Yui. Ikari\\'s dependence upon Fuyutsuki as both confidant and his chief lieutenant is shown by the many times that Fuyutski takes the initiative for action without waiting for direction from Ikari.\\n\\nAs had been mentioned and implied in the series, while obviously kindly disposed towards Yui, at all times Fuyutsuki maintained a professional demeanor towards her. It is not intimated how the Destrudo experiment that \\'killed\\' her and ensconced her soul into EVA Unit 01 affected him. The depth of his feelings for her, however, is revealed when immediately prior to dematerializing into LCL during Instrumentality, Fuyutsuki witnesses an image of Lilith-as-Yui which appears to float down to embrace him, comforting him in his transition to a non-corporeal state.\\n\\n(Source: afufu.net/freewill/)'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Aliases: Lacus Clyne \\nAge: 17 [GSD]\\nDate of birth: July 2\\nNationality: PLANT [GSD] \\nGenetic type: Coordinator\\n\\nMeer Campbell has a voice that sounds very similar to her idol\\'s, Lacus Clyne, and she uses this to her advantage as she impersonates Lacus throughout the episodes. Reflecting this, both Meer Campbell and Lacus Clyne are voiced by Rie Tanaka in the Japanese version and by Chantal Strand in the English dub. Jillian Michaels provides the English singing voice of both as well.Her name means \"lake\" in Dutch, possibly reflecting her role in the story as her idol—Lacus\\'s name also means lake but in Latin.\\n\\nMeer is contacted by Chairman Gilbert Durandal, who asks her to pose as Lacus to enhance his political position. After she accepts the job, Meer\\'s face is surgically altered to look identical to Lacus; however, tell-tale signs that reveal their own identities—their hairclips and attire.\\n\\nMeer takes Lacus\\' image as a pop star further: singing more upbeat versions of her songs, more dancing, more revealing clothing, etc.\\n\\nRealizing that Lacus has a political influence greater than his, Durandal uses Meer to gain support for his policies. Meer believes in Durandal\\'s ideals, and is glad to further his agenda by impersonating Lacus. Meer\\'s belief is that by impersonating Lacus, she will be loved by everyone. However, a few people can tell the difference; Athrun Zala, Kira Yamato, and most of the other major characters in the Three Ships Alliance easily know she is not the real Lacus, especially since Lacus has been living with most of the senior members of the Three Ships Alliance in Orb, and later onboard the Archangel. In The Edge (a manga series depicting Athrun\\'s side of the story), Gilbert Durandal acknowledges to Athrun that Meer is an impostor.\\n\\nMeer is flirty and tends to be very excitable, especially in Athrun\\'s presence.\\n\\nWhen she first meets Athrun, she introduces herself as Meer Campbell, and admits she is not Lacus Clyne. When Athrun attempts to convince her to escape Gibraltar with him, she refuses, claiming that she is Lacus and that she prefers to be Lacus. Later in the series, Meer insists to Athrun and Lacus herself that she is Lacus.'}},\n",

He later surprises the Minerva pilots by insisting that they call him by his first name, since pilots of any rank are all equals on the battlefield.\\n\\nHeine Westenfluss is a ZAFT pilot who originally piloted the orange mobile suit Blaze ZAKU Phantom, and later the orange mobile suit ZGMF-X2000 GOUF Ignited. Heine Westenfluss is considered an ace pilot of ZAFT, not only wearing the ZAFT red uniform, given to pilots who have graduated at the top of their class, but also with the FAITH insignia on his uniform, indicating that he's of the FAITH detachment and reports directly to Chairman Gilbert Durandal. Heine first appeared in Phase 19, where he was there to escort Athrun Zala, Shinn Asuka, and Lunamaria Hawke to meet Chairman Dullindal at Diocuia after the Battle of Gulnahan. However, it has been suggested that the orange mobile suit that appeared in the Battle of Aprilius One in Phase 9 (Prideful Fang) is the Blaze ZAKU Phantom piloted by Heine Westenfluss; his performance in the battle has been noted as exceptional, as he destroyed a great number of mobile suits and several battleships. He also fought previously in the Bloody Valentine War (in particular the Second Battle of Jachin Due), as the pilot of the YFX-600R GuAIZ Experimental Firearms Type, and fought against Earth Alliance ace Morgan Chevalier.\\n\\nHeine was decidedly an optimistic, but realistic, soldier who didn't stand too much on ceremony, and was also quite talkative and ernest in his attempts to raise the morale of his fellow pilots. Despite considering himself an elite, Heine was respected by both superiors and subordinates as a capable pilot and officer. Although Heine was part of Athrun's squad after his transfer to the Minerva, Heine was treated almost as a superior to Athrun by his peers, even by Athrun himself. During the Battle of Dardanelles, Heine's GOUF Ignited's primary offensive functions were disabled by ZGMF-X10A Freedom, piloted by Kira Yamato. While attempting a counter-attack on Kira, he got into the way of the ZGMF-X88S Gaia, piloted by Stella Loussier, who sliced Heine in half as she tried to attacked Freedom.\"}},\n",

He suffers from a hereditary curse originally inflicted upon his grandfather Miyatsu (also a Buddhist monk) by Naraku, who exploited Miyatsu\\'s weakness for attractive women by taking the shape of one, and reflected one of Miyatsu\\'s ofuda back to pierce the palm of his right hand (it appears to be his left hand in the English language manga where right and left are reversed). The hole in his hand became a kazana (air void or \"wind tunnel\") which sucks in anything not nailed down, regardless of mass. \\n\\nMiroku uses the kazana as a powerful weapon against youkai, but as he grows older, the kazana grows inevitably larger, and if the curse is not broken by Naraku\\'s death, it will grow too large to control and consume Miroku himself—the same fate his grandfather and his father have already met. Probably as a result of this, Miroku takes a hedonistic approach to life which is uncharacteristic of a proper monk; he is a talented con artist who does not hesitate to invent fictitious supernatural menaces which he can then offer to combat in return for food and shelter, and like his grandfather he has a distinct weakness for pretty women. He makes a point of asking every attractive woman he meets if she will bear his child, claiming that he wants to be sure of an heir to continue his pursuit of Naraku if he dies, and his hands have a seemingly uncontrollable habit of wandering—something which often gets him soundly thumped by Sango, the favorite subject of his groping; however, in spite of his less-than-saintly behavior, Miroku proves to have a core of deep spirituality and, as a result, impressive spiritual powers.

He is a very powerful demon who seems to have no true equal when it comes to raw power; although given the chance in volume twenty-three, he could not defeat Naraku. Although fandom refers to him as the Lord of the Western Lands, this title appears at no point in the manga. Takahashi also stated that Sesshoumaru has no permanent home. Unlike almost every other demon in the world of InuYasha, he has no interest in possessing even one shard of the Shikon Jewel.\\n\\nSesshoumaru first appears in search of the sword called Tessaiga, created from their father Inu-no-Taisho's fang, which has the power to kill a hundred yōkai with one swing; however, Inu-no-Taisho left Tessaiga to Inuyasha, and Sesshoumaru instead inherited the Tenseiga, a sword which cannot harm the living, but can bring the dead back to life. Inu-no-Taisho did this in the hopes that Sesshoumaru would learn compassion. Considering Tenseiga useless to him, Sesshoumaru battles Inuyasha several times for possession of Tessaiga, and when Tessaiga is broken by a bite from Naraku's incarnation Goshinki, Sesshoumaru has Goshinki's fangs forged into the evil blade Tokijin, which only he is powerful enough to control. Initially, Sesshoumaru is ruthless and cruel in his pursuit of Tessaiga and his dealings with his brother.\\n\\nDespite having a hatred for humans, he seems to care for Rin, a little human girl who was orphaned after her village was destroyed by demons. Rin found Sesshomaru in the woods by the village she lived in, and noticed that he was injured (due to a previous fight with Inuyasha) and she tried to help him. Sesshomaru refused her help, but after finding her body nearly devoured by Koga's wolves later on, he used Tenseiga to bring her back to life. Now Rin follows Sesshomaru around and thinks of herself as one of his servants.\"}},\n",

He also awakens the spirit residing in the Puzzle, but Yuugi is not aware of this until much later in the story.\\n\\nWhen Yuugi does become aware, he and the spirit become very close, with him calling the spirit \"Mou Hitori No Boku\"—The Other Me—and the spirit calling him \"Aibou\\'—Partner. Yugi then becomes a vessel for the spirit and he is told that his duty is to help the spirit find his lost memories. With the help of his friends, he helps the Pharaoh regain his memories while overcoming the most difficult of situations.\\n\\nYuugi is mostly seen living with his grandfather, since his parents are mostly on business trips. His mother, Ashita, makes a very brief appearance in the beginning of the second season, when Yuugi argues with the spirit. Yuugi is also very gifted as a duelist with the Duel Monsters card game, thanks to the expertise and upbringing of his grandfather. \\n\\nYuugi\\'s deck, throughout the series, was really his grandfather\\'s, since his grandfather gave him his deck in episode 1 to battle Seto Kaiba. However, in the last season—Pharaoh\\'s Memory—he uses his own deck, which contains magicians, spell-casters, and machines.\\n\\nYuugi is also seen as a \"Ladies\\' Man\" in the series, according to the KCGP filler. However, from the beginning, it has been obvious that he has a crush on Anzu Mazaki, his childhood friend.\\n\\nYu-Gi-Oh! GX\\nYuugi Mutou makes several apperances in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX. He is first seen as a grown adult in the first episode, whom Judai Yuki runs into on his way to the entrance exam at Duel Academy. Yuugi then hands him Winged Kuriboh and walks away. There are also several mentions of him throughout the series. \\n\\nYu-Gi-Oh! The Movie - Ultra Fusion! Bonds Over Time and Space!\\nYuugi is one the main characters in this 10th Anniversary special of Yu-Gi-Oh! He, along with Judai Yuki of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX and Yusei Fudou of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D\\'s, battle Paradox in order to save Duel Monsters and the existence of time itself.'}},\n",

Being one of the earliest and most successful known Newtypes, her powers are accompanied by a profound spiritual awareness.\\n\\nDespite her gentle nature, Lalah is fiercely loyal to the man who saved her life —- Char Aznable, the scheming \"Red Comet\", who found her in an Indian brothel where she worked after losing her parents in the war. She was assigned to pilot the Newtype use mobile armor MAN-08 Elmeth as a part of the Newtype research project conducted by the Flanagan Institute. Lalah is ranked as an ensign under Char.\\n\\nLalah and Amuro Ray first met on Side 6, where Amuro found Lalah in front of a lakeside house. They spoke briefly and Amuro was attracted to her with his Newtype powers. They met again some time later when Amuro\\'s car got stuck in the mud. Another vehicle pulled over and offered to help him, aboard it was Lalah and Char Aznable, Amuro\\'s archrival (the two had not yet seen each other face to face). Amuro immediately recognised both of them, but Char and Lalah had yet to figure out Amuro\\'s identity.\\n\\nLalah left a profound impact on Amuro and was considered his first great love. During the Elmeth\\'s test run which saw its Newtype \"bits\" weaponry wreak havoc on the Federal Fleet guarding the newly-captured Zeon base Solomon, Amuro in the Gundam engaged the Elmeth but found out the pilot was Lalah. Both then realized they were soulmates and shared a \"Newtype bonding\", a sort of telepathic bond. Unfortunately Char arrived and chastised Lalah for \"consorting with the enemy\" and raised his beam naginata to strike down Amuro\\'s wingman Sayla Mass, piloting the CoreBooster jet. Lalah told Char to stop, for she sensed the pilot was Char\\'s sister Artesia (Sayla Mass is her adopted name since young). Char hesitated but this gave Amuro the opportunity to sever the weapon arm of Char\\'s Gelgoog, rendering it incapacitated. Amuro went for the killing blow but Lalah knocked away Char and took the fatal strike. This has a profound effect on both men, as their rivalry escalates from a professional to a very personal one which culminated in the movie Char\\'s Counterattack.\\n\\nAlthough she died before the end of the One Year War, Lalah Sune\\'s spirit occasionally returns from beyond the grave to haunt both Char and Amuro Ray, as seen in Char\\'s Counterattack.'}},\n",

He has no compassion or mercy for his enemies and he lives by the Shinsengumi code \"Aku Soku Zan (悪即斬),\" literally \"Slay Evil Immediately,\" but more poetically rendered as \"Swift Death To Evil.\" His signature technique is the Gatotsu, a left-handed thrust and a variation of the Hirazuki technique developed by Toshizou Hijikata, the Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi. Although the Gatotsu is a fictional technique only found within the Rurouni Kenshin series, the Hirazuki is a real technique that was used by many of the Shinsengumi members.'}},\n",

She also has dark brown pupils and a fair complexion. Because of the effects of being a Flame Haze, Shana\\'s body age remains to that of a girl of 11 to 12 years old. Upon invoking her powers as a Flame Haze, her hair and eyes change color to a fiery crimson, with embers fluttering from her head down.\\n\\nIn her first few years as a Flame Haze, she wears an all-black attire consisting of a shirt, pants and her Treasure Tool Yogasa in the form of a trench coat. However, after she decided to stay in Misaki City, she is most usually seen with the Misaki City Municipal High School uniform and when in combat, has the Yogasa as a cape worn over her clothes.\\n\\nShe is later seen wearing a red-and-black frilly dress on her stay inside the Seireiden. \\n\\nInitially, she is concentrated solely on her duty as a Flame Haze, not even considering getting a name as she didn\\'t see any importance having it. She sees Yuuji only as a Torch, an object, albeit marginally interesting because of his status as a Mystes. However, she slowly opens up to Yuuji, coming to think of him as a person despite being a Torch, and eventually comes to show affection to him. Her duty made her indifferent towards human life at first, but through Yuuji\\'s influence, Shana has opened up slightly, although she still remains confused and disgruntled by some human traits which she considers as pointless, although some of it is used to mask her jealousy of her desired monopoly on Yuuji.\\n\\nShana has a habit of saying \"Urusai! Urusai! Urusai!\" (\"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!\") whenever Yuuji asks her questions or makes remarks that disturb her original worldview or embarrass her. But in reality they really care for each other. She has a great fondness for anything sweet, eventually putting melon bread above her preference.\\n\\nShana is shown to be highly intelligent as she has gotten a perfect score on every exam and is talented in Physical Education. She is shown, however, to be naive when it comes to social affairs, once even unabashfully asking \"how babies are made\" to Chigusa. \\n\\nKnown only as the \"Flaming-Haired, Blazing-Eyed Hunter,\" Shana bears no name until she meets Yuuji, who names her after the sword she wields. As a \"Flame Haze,\" Shana is sworn to protect the balance of the world by hunting down the \"Guze no Tomogara;\" monsters from the \"Crimson Realm\" who come to earth in order to harvest the \"Power of Existence\" from its denizens. Together with Alastor, \"Flame of the Heavens\" and Shana\\'s guide who lives within her, and speaks to her through a necklace she wears, she has become one of the most powerful Flame Haze in existence.\\n\\nShana is said to be the most powerful, known and feared by most Crimson Denizens with her title alone. This has allowed her to defeat many powerful Denizens, and permits her many different abilities, including her proficiency with the Nietono no Shana, the ability to wield flames, manipulate the Power of Existence, harbor extrasensory traits, and fly with wings of flame. In the third volume of the manga, the first volume of the novel, and the movie, Alastor states that the reason why she did not explode after being shot by Friagne\\'s Trigger Happy was because she held a capacity that existed in dimensional space, who was able to contain the Flame of Heaven\\'s (and more); He has thus stated her as \"The Great One\".\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, she demonstrates a clear lack of experience in battle, as noted by Sophie Sawallisch, who has witnessed her fighting style first-hand.This is once responsible for her defeat against Flame Haze Margery Daw, who is a specialist in Power of Unrestraint. \\n\\n\\n\\nDespite being the title character of the anime, Shana has few character relations with many of the characters in the show. That would be because of the manner she was raised. Wilhelmina, Shiro and Alastor mostly focused on her physical and mental being, forgetting that being as socially adept is as important. This was, as Alastor said, one of their mistakes, since they thought that they would just teach her these feelings when she grows up a little more, not realizing that these feelings should be developed, and could not be taught so hastily. (Although, Shiro did teach her indirectly that love is the most powerful unrestricted spell of all.)\\n\\nHer main social interest is Yuuji, whom she sees as her love interest. Her relationship with Yuuji is one of the driving forces of the series. Shana takes orders and advice from the Crimson Lord she is bound to, Alastor, and has a mentor and guardian in the form of Wilhelmina Carmel. Kazumi Yoshida is her love-rival for Yuuji, and Shana treats her with contempt and disdain. She generally treats most other characters with ignorance and indifference, with the exception of Chigusa Sakai, who she looks to as a source in answering certain difficulties when Alastor or Wilhelmina are unable to do so. Shana eventually starts to be more open to the other characters, especially in regards to her relationship with Kazumi becoming more friendly. \\n\\n After meeting Yuuji, Shana goes through a chaotic phase in she experiences new emotions like love, jealousy, hatred, and loneliness. This leads her to making rash decisions in battle as she\\'s unable to identify or deal with what she\\'s feeling. When Shana finally realizes that having Yuuji with her in battle helps her fight better, she begins to unlock new abilities and becomes more proficient in battle.'}},\n",

Her first appearance is in volume five, where she emerges to assist Daisuke.

Later on, she begins living in the Niwa household and frequently helps Daisuke whenever she can.\\n\\nIn the anime, Towa is a bird statue that Dark was to steal from the ruins of an old house that was damaged by a landslide. When Daisuke first finds her statue he calls her very valuable and from then on (when she was later released and took the form of a cute young girl) she became very loyal and compassionate towards Daisuke. Personality wise she is very optimistic, enjoys shopping and cooking, compassionate, caring and is somewhat of a romantic.\\n\\nUnlike in the manga, she is also able to retain her human form during the day and only occupies her bird form when she is weak, flustered (whenever she gets kissed by Dark) or playing with With. She stays with the Niwa family as their house maid.\\n\\nTowa (in human form, as the Niwa family\\'s maid) dresses in the Gothic Lolita style.'}},\n",

However, Mizuho is always nervous about being found out and constantly worries that it will happen. In spite of this, he was well received on his first day at school and has already become very popular among the students. At first he was shocked when he found out about the will, but with the help of his childhood friend Mariya Mikado, who also attends the school, he was able to resign himself to transferring to the school. Despite making the change, he still uses language which is usually only used by males in Japan such as boku (僕), meaning \"I\".\\n\\nWhen Mizuho was younger, he had very little self-confidence and in effect often would follow Mariya around, depending on her as his closest childhood friend. Additionally, his mother died from an unexplained illness when he was younger and one of her last requests to her husband, Mizuho\\'s father, was to not force Mizuho to have his hair cut until after he had grown up. Mizuho explains this was so that he would be free to make his own choice of what hairstyle he wanted later on, and obviously he kept it, thinking it suited him best.\\n\\nMizuho\\'s had to use the surname Miyanokōji, his mother\\'s maiden name, in order to enter into the school; his actual surname is Kaburagi (鏑木). The Kaburagi family\\'s biggest rival is the Itsukushima family, both of which are very well-endowed in terms of money and power. Mizuho didn\\'t realize it at first, but Takako is a member of that Itsukushima family. Despite this, Mizuho doesn\\'t see her as a rival and enjoys her company very much. In fact, they share Japanese history class together and sit next to each other. They often talk to each other during class by either whispering or passing notes.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Ritsuka\\'s classmate. Despite her ditzy, bubbly exterior, she is sharp and goodhearted. On Ritsuka\\'s first day in school, she immediately is overcome with awe and fascination. At the prodding of her mean-spirited classmates, she befriends him, although he is very reluctant. As Ritsuka overcomes his initial impressions of her and realizes she is rather smart, they become good friends.\\n\\nYuiko and Ritsuka\\'s friendship greatly irritates their classmate, Yayoi. He had been recently rejected by Yuiko, although rather sorrowfully, claiming she only dated boys taller than her. Much to Yuiko\\'s dismay, Ritsuka insists their friendship is platonic and it indeed remains that way. However, in two separate confessions to Shinonome Hitomi, Yuiko professes her love and devotion to Ritsuka. Their relationship is close, but Yuiko\\'s seems to be a one-sided obsession. One incident of Ritsuka actually demonstrating care for Yuiko is in volume 2 of the manga and episode 4 of the anime, when she is bullied by her \\'friends\\', whom Ritsuka fittingly said were using her. Because she had brought Ritsuka some homemade strawberry jam, they went so far as to smash the jar in front of her, and demanded she apologize for breaking school rules. Ritsuka came to her aid and stated that they were \\'less than human\\'. This may have spurred on her love for him. Though, sadly for her, a notable scene in volume 4 depicts Ritsuka abandoning Yuiko abruptly to go to Soubi\\'s aid, and Yuiko sadly recalls her efforts to become good friends with Ritsuka, but never achieving any results.\\n\\nAs the series progresses, a rather unusual yet harmonious friendship is struck between Yuiko and Soubi. Although it seems their personalities would clash, they have a unique understanding of each other.\\n\\nIn an early 2005 interview in Japanese magazine Pafu, Kouga Yun stated: \"She emerged when I wondered, \\'What kind of girl would it take for Ritsuka to be happy?\\' While she was created to match Ritsuka, she changes from meeting him...with some injection of intelligence (laugh). She honestly wants to change to become worthy of Ritsuka because she likes him. So if Soubi wasn\\'t around, they\\'d make a great couple (laugh).\"\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Ritsuka and Yuiko\\'s teacher. She is very naive and innocent, and painfully aware of these characteristics. At twenty-three years old, she is teased and ridiculed for retaining her ears (and therefore her virginity) to such an age. She is visibly embarrassed, but as the story progresses, she gains confidence and pride over making her own choices.\\n\\nHitomi is greatly troubled by Ritsuka\\'s mother and the injuries he sustains from her, and greatly desires to involve herself in the situation to make a change, despite her fears and her colleagues\\' dissent.\\n\\nHer very caring and naive nature clashes spectacularly when confronted with Soubi. He brusquely rejects her and says he doesn\\'t care for older women, despite the fact she never made a romantic move towards him and no more than three years older than him. Despite his cold treatment, Hitomi seems to have had some feelings for Soubi, due to the fact in volume 2 of the manga (episode 8 of the anime), she burst into tears and brooded over him. His brash actions are mysterious, but understood a bit more when you consider his undiscerning hatred towards teachers as a result of his experiences with Ritsu Minami.\\n\\nAlthough he has rejected her, it can be noted that Soubi enjoys tormenting her to some degree. In their first meeting, he takes pleasure in confronting her uneasily face-to-face. In volume 2 of the manga (episode 6 of the anime), he holds her closely when she faints. This is notable because there are only two characters he physically interacts with in the entire series: one being Hitomi and the other Ritsuka.\\n\\nReasons for this awkward behavior towards Hitomi may be stemmed from jealousy. It is interesting to note that Soubi refers to Hitomi as \\'childish\\', despite her being three years older than he is. Yet he still respectfully calls her \"Shinonome-sensei.\" The only way he degrades her is by her sexuality, possibly because Hitomi has remained a virgin while he may have lost his ‘ears’ at a much earlier age, perhaps unwillingly. In volume 2 of the manga and episode 6 of the anime, Soubi also \\'saves\\' Hitomi from the male Zeroes, Youji and Natsuo. They threatened to get rid of her ears, despite the Zeroes being very young themselves, and she protested immensely. Although she is grateful for Soubi\\'s protection, it only embarrasses her more. In comparison with his extreme dislike of his own teacher figure, Ritsu, Soubi still manages to treat Hitomi as a subordinate, constantly belittling her. Ultimately, their relationship highlights traditional sexual tension, complementing the major same sex pairings and adding interest and variety to the story.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

In person, Holland is not always as cool and composed as the photos in ray=out magazine might suggest—he frequently loses his temper when a situation turns bad, or when faced with insubordination. He has thrown Renton in the brig for using Nirvash without permission, and has beaten Renton for particularly vexing transgressions. His concern over Eureka's depression motivates him to show illogical animosity towards Renton. His relationship with Talho keeps him from getting too wild, but at times their own relationship suffers whenever he's angry. Holland truly loves Talho, but does not know how to react, especially to her fears that his absolute commitment to protecting Eureka means that he favors Eureka over Talho. Holland also suffers from the memories of his bloody past actions, and in reaction to these sometimes lashes out violently.\"}},\n",

In the game, Rin is the role that the player assumes. As noted by Kaede, Rin's main virtue is his kindness. This is both his greatest strength, as the girls love him because of this, and his greatest weakness, as shown later in the series by his indecisiveness and goal to make everyone happy, which usually ends up hurting them instead. Rin tends to show minimal initiative when dealing with the girls around him (mostly because of the abuse he receives by fellow male classmates over his perceived relationship with his childhood friend Kaede). However, he starts to spend more and more time with both Lisianthus (Sia) and Nerine after they arrive and starts to develop feelings for them. With regards to Kaede, he thinks of her as a childhood friend only. When people comment that he and Kaede would make a good couple, Rin either waves it off or says that it is strange to think of it that way. This distance kept between them is caused in part by Kaede and Rin's dark past.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)\"}},\n",

He believes that he is a divine and immortal being, with the authority to do, take or destroy whatever he pleases. As the result, he appears fearless, childish, and without a care in the world. His lifestyle is relaxed and hedonistic, and when not attending to his godly duties of smiting the natives of Skypeia, he spends his time sleeping or eating (Enel\\'s favourite fruit is apples) in his residence, being waited on hand and foot by beautiful women. This attitude carries over to his battles, where he\\'s hardly serious and barely annoyed - instead he\\'s relaxed, and enjoys himself by effortlessly absorbing attacks, and humiliating his opponents. In his fight against Kamakiri, he even went to sleep in the middle of the fight, in order to prove his immortality.\\n\\nEnel holds no regard for other\\'s lives except his own, and has no moral qualms about killing thousands- instead he sees it as his godly duty, and laughs as he sends Skypeia to its doom.

Before Luffy showed up, his fruit power and mantra ability made his God complex completely legitimate.

       "   'about': 'Akito Wanijima and Agito Wanijima are two personalities that make up the Fang King of the Bloody Road. They are originally part of the Wind SWAT team, in which they are treated like a tool by their older brother, Kaito. Ikki eventually saves them, and they join Kogarasumaru. They switch who is in control by using an eye patch. Akito is innocent and non-violent. He becomes attracted to Ikki, much to Ikki\\'s discontent, and often tries to kiss, bathe, and sleep next to or with Ikki. He states he was the original Fang King until he became disgusted with himself and became unable to use AT. Agito then appears and starts using ATs, while following his own violent and bloodthirsty nature. He tends to swear a lot and uses four hooks dangling from straps on his legs to battle and tear people apart. When equipped with the Fang Regalia, he releases a pressurized \"Fang\" through the instantaneous acceleration and braking of the A-T\\'s wheel motors, vacuuming and compressing air into a piercing shock wave. As the manga develops, Agito grows to respect Ikki and his strength. In some scenes in the manga, Agito is shown to be very weak while sleeping, so much that the guys put him in some very humorous scenes because of his weakness. It is also learned that Akito had been acting as Agito\\'s tuner up until now. However, he wasn\\'t able to fully hear his own biorhythm, only allowing him to keep his other half\\'s A-T and Regalia barely operational. Because roughly 76% of the Fang Regalia was not operational, Agito had difficulty with fully utilizing his \"Fangs\". It isn\\'t until Yayoi tunes him that the Fang Regalia is fully operational and complete. Akito is very affectionate to Ikki as well as Agito to respect his way of doing things. In the manga, it is showed that Agito has some sort of affection towards Nakayama as he tells her to \"protect\" herself or not which means she should protect herself and not counting on him or others all the time.\\n\\nAnother personality, Lind Wanijima (鰐島 凜鱗人, Wanijima Rindo?), emerges during the battle with Orca. She claims to be the original personality and she is much stronger than the other two, utilizing the Fang Regalia on a different level. She is a \"brain charger\", or a person who has been \"charged\" with the ability of gravity children. Lind\\'s eyes have crosses on them, similar to those of gravity children, but her eyes have two crosses, with one set at a 45 degree angle and overlayed over the other. She does not care for others. It is unknown if she has any feelings at all towards anyone, including Akito and Agito Wanijima, though she has displayed more human compassion towards the then-incapacitated Yayoi Nakayama. She kissed him in chapter 194, while battling Orca underwater, to give him her air so that he could continue battling. It is revealed by Thor of Slepinir that Lind found the \"original\" sky king, with the \"answer\".\\n=Tricks= \\nAGITO Ride fall Bloody roll, soul 1800°: \\nBackward Cross Ridefall Upper Fang: \"TWINCAM\": A surprise tag-team attack using \\nAGITO Bloody fang Ride fall \"Leviathan\": \\nAGITO Bloody Blade Fang: \\nBloody Road -&gt;Saucer Crush&lt;-: \\nAGITO &amp; AKITO × KAZU Grand Fang Fire Bird:\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

Onigiri is a pervert and characterized as a pig. He has an unusual way of using his perspiration, usually during overall perverted moments, to create illusions. He also has a strange way of using his AT by sitting upside down on it (to the chagrin of his female schoolmates whose skirts he tends to look up while doing this). This way of riding proved to be very dangerous, for both Onigiri and his opponent, as he flails his legs back and forth(doing damage if he\\'s close enough), but can also fall off, landing directly on the point of his head and streaking on the ground until he stops (this, however, is never shown, only an image of an actual onigiri in said position). He is in the same class as Ikki, and follows the \"Smell Road.\" (the authenticity of this road is arguable, since one can\\'t really tell if this was just another one of Oh!Great\\'s jokes. However stated by Akito/Agito in Kyoto, there are \"hundreds\" of roads. But out of those only 8 roads can be called Road of King.) He can also go as fast (or possibly faster) for short spurts than Ringo, when the right motivation is present. At chapter 171 Onigiri is seen trainning with his friends in order to get stronger than before, most of his techniques have the ability to affect the enemy\\'s senses, create illusions. On many chapters he\\'s seen as an upside down buddha with supernatural powers. (Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

Ringo is in love with Ikki but does not dare to tell him. She helps Kogarasumaru in times of trouble under the guise of Croissant Mask (Croissiant Kamen). Ringo is a King Class AT user. Ringo is determined to show Ikki the \"fear\" of flying through the air, because she doesn\\'t want to see him suffer the same fate the last \\'Wind King\\' did. To this end she was even willing to brutally attack him using her \\'Thorn Regalia\\'. During the battle she seems to have total control of the fight as Ikki is completely out-classed. But Kururu Sumeragi saves Ikki with a mid-air installation of the Bagram prototype cores. Ikki then becomes more than a match for Ringo. The fight then seemingly ends in a draw with Ikki carrying Ringo back home. After that battle Ikki leaves the Noyamano residence, but not before Ringo finally reveals her feeling for Ikki and kisses him goodbye. Later in the Tower of Tropheum, Killik reveals the true purpose of Ringo as leader of Sleeping Forest. Due to the final battle for the Sky King takes place where not only the air is incredibly dense, and the atmosphere is giving off the feeling of crushing you, Ringo is completely immune to it. Thus making her the perfect warrior to protect the Sky Regalia.\\n\\nRingo is often depicted to be a warrior in an armor, with a shield and blade, and a pair of wings made out of blades. At this point in her introduction, she is usually in the middle of a forest with dead bodies sprawled around her. Her introduction stays the same throughout the manga: \"The Fruit of the Forbidden Forest Which Lures One into a Deep Slumber... Crazy Apple.\" (A play on her name since \"Ringo\" means Apple in Japanese.)\\n\\nRingo (along with Mikan and Ume) are not biological sisters of Rika. It was revealed in Chapter 154 by Kilik. A year or so after the creation of the original Sleeping Forest, it was revealed by Kilik that three unknown \"gravity children\" are staying with Rika, implying that the research for Air Treck is still going on somewhere else. In chapter 174, Ringo is seen watching Kogarasumaru training for their B-Class match against White Wolf clan, then she sees Hako talking to a mysterious girl that was seen with the Sora brothers on chapter 163.'}},\n",

She\\'s taken great interest in Ikki, whom she believes is destined to one day become the legendary Sky King, and who has practically idolized her since watching her ride AT through his neighborhood. Despite protests, she convinces Ikki to take Genesis under his leadership after Kogarasumaru\\'s triumph over Behemoth, and her interactions with Ikki eventually draws the ire of the new Sleeping Forest team, led by Ringo.\\n\\nShe also appears to have a somewhat, though romantic interest in Ikki, and is not hesitant to allow him to grope her breasts. Though Ikki has no objections, and appears to have a crush on Simca, it is Ringo who always stops Simca from getting out of hand. These actions are not so persistent, and after the defeat of Behemoth, her character takes a dramatic change which is noted by Spitfire soon after.\\n\\nSimca, in later chapters, had her hair cut short and her usual care-free attitude of \\'Migratory Bird\\' has all but disappeared, especially when anything related to Ikki is concerned. She constantly tried to get Ikki to formally sign on as head of Genesis but he refused, even calling her his \\'enemy\\' something that brought tears to her eyes moments before she was attacked.\\n\\nHer most recent appearance was on board Nike\\'s ship, where he aggressively expresses his sexual attraction to her by sexually assaulting her, and she plays along, although she prays for Kogarasumaru\\'s safety soon after. Simca is again seen meeting with Ringo and Kururu to give Ikki the way to enter the gram scale tournament since they were disqualified, and Ikki asks her out to go on a \"date\" with her once the tournament ends, telling her to meet in the place where he discovered ATs and her for the first time though during the meeting she appears to be hoping to get a kiss from Ikki. After she boards back with Nike and Sora, she says the reason why she likes him so much is because of him being able to look so strong in one small moment, and is seen crying tears of happiness. Simca was one of the first-generation Gravity Children, along with Spitfire, Kilik, Sora and others. She is also Kilik\\'s twin sister.\\n\\nIn the extras of Air Gear Volume 3, the author shows that Simca had a much different character design which consisted of a tanktop, long arm gloves and pants and different shaped goggles, before her final image.'}},\n",

She certainly seems to display Himeko's lack of self-confidence and strong emotional bond with Chikane's counterpart, Kaon, even protecting her and providing her with energy at a cost to her own well-being.

       "   'about': 'Tarlotte, also known as \"Tarlotte of the Aligned Planets,\" is the Absolute Angel Batraz (Badorasu). Her anger lays waste to all who stand before her, but she has a childish personality and mind to go with her childish body. Tarlotte frequently has trouble finding the right words to express herself. While attacking the academy, she absorbs the life energy of the students. She has a rather odd relationship with her companion, Sōjirō; while she apparently enjoys his food and seems to rely on him to care for her, she frequently vents her frustrations upon him through acts of violence. Her Absolute Angel emblem is located on her right thigh. Her tail is merely attached to her underwear, though it does move to her emotions. \\n\\nAlthough her design resembles Nekoko from Kannazuki no Miko, Tarlotte\\'s name reference to the two characters from Kaishaku\\'s older work, Magical Cat Girl Taruto, Taruto and Charlotte. Taruto\\'s character is also voiced by Hisayo Mochizuki.'}},\n",

Sure, he turns out to be an amazing fighter when he\\'s unceremoniously tossed into the middle of a war he didn\\'t know was raging, but fighting is never a thing of central importance to him. Like most of the children on Tatsumiya Island, he had no idea the earth was under invasion and strives throughout the series to understand why the adults hid this from him, and especially, why his estranged childhood friend Soushi is so willing to do whatever it takes to defend this humble island. Naturally, to someone with such a gentle nature, having to fight for his life constantly is a bewildering experience that causes him to question who he is and what he believes in, but he really grows as a person over the course of the story and becomes everything a real and uncliched hero ought to be.\\n\\nKazuki is originally the pilot of the Mark Elf (XI), but is given the much more powerful Fafner \"Mark Sein\" later in the series. His mother, Akane, was assimilated by Festum long ago and he now lives with his father Fumihiko. He enjoys getting to know Soushi outside of battle again, and feels comforted when he\\'s with Maya. Living with only his father, he does all the cooking and shopping and thus is an excellent chef. He also seems to be very bad at card games (he\\'s too honest to be good at bluffing).\\n\\n(Source: AnimeNfo)'}},\n",

For such a strong and thoughtful man, he is surprisingly quiet and kind-hearted. Like all of his generation, he hates the Festum and once wanted an all-out war with them—but fatherhood has been very good for him. He raises Kazuki alone, as his wife Akane was killed long ago protecting him from the Festum. Although Akane was a higher ranking officer than him (he took her last name upon their marriage), he is also a seasoned soldier who has shed blood—both Festum and human—and always keeps it a priority to prevent the children from having to do the same.\\n\\nFumihiko and Kazuki live in a small house that doubles as a ceramics workshop where Fumihiko makes traditional, Japanese clay pots to sell for a living. He hates having to send his son out to fight but tries to keep a strong front to give Kazuki as much stability and reassurance as possible. He has a healthy respect for the intellect and abilities of Minashiro Soushi, despite his youth, and relies on him to help Kazuki along during this difficult time.\\n\\n(Source: AnimeNfo)'}},\n",

Sachiko, Youko noted, always walked looked like she was fighting internally with something. With an endless desire to help (or meddle, as Sei put it) people Youko took Sachiko as her petite soeur. She had Sachiko quit her after school lessons (or in the novel, hinted about it) and once scolded her for not expressing her emotions and opinions. Much like Sachiko did to Yumi. Prior to graduating, Youko took Yumi aside and asked her to look after her stubborn and \"uncute\" little sister. Then later during Sachiko and Yumi\\'s separation she felt slightly jealous of the close bond between them. Youko considers herself to be Sachiko\\'s onee-sama even beyond graduating from Lillian. \\n\\nAside from her petite soeur Youko is probably closest to Satou Sei. They met during middle school when Youko approached Sei about joining clubs. Sei asked if Youko too felt alienated from the class but Youko said she simply became interested in Sei. Disinterested in this, Sei called her a meddler. During Sei\\'s relationship with Shiori it was Youko who constantly tried to reach out to Sei. It was also Youko who asked Shiori to leave Sei a letter when she left. Fans have speculated that Youko has an unrequited love for her friend and the Sei/Youko pairing is very popular within the fandom. \\n\\nAfter graduating from Lillian, Youko attends law school.

Ryou gets happy when he realizes that by piloting the Titan Model he can run for so much time without having to stop for catching breath or feeling chest-ache. But he has to decide whether to leave his dog, Puku, on the island, or poison him, because he can't bring it with him on the island-ship. Fortunately Karin agrees to take care of Puku, and Ryou can leave along with Yumi and the other pilots to lure away the Festums.\\n\\n\\nYumi decides to ask for a reduced scheduled time to pilot the Fafner models, but to no avail. Ryou decides to support her by saying to the commander in charge that Yumi's father didn't make this plan without thinking about the life of the whole crew, and ultimately resolves to make him accept their proposal. Yumi thanks Ryou for what he said in his speech, and starts getting along with him again.\\n\\n\\nThe discovery of an escape procedure when the plans end boosts again their hope to live, but before coming back to the island they must fulfill their last duty and stop the Festums from reaching Tatsumiya Island.\\n\\n\\n(Source: Mahq, l_has_a_keikaku)\"}},\n",

When they were younger, he cared very much for her, protecting her when their town of Evergreen was assaulted by bandits. He is later kidnapped by the Claw, and Wendy joins Van in order to rescue him. However, when she finally finds him, it proves out he no longer is kept with the Claw against his will. He reveals that he has joined forces with him in order to realize the Claw\\'s dream of eradicating all sorrow on the planet by creating a new world.\\n\\nLike his sister, he is usually kind and compassionate, but can be fiercely independent when he wants to. Although he has freely joined the Claw, he still has his doubts and struggles to rid himself of his suspicious feelings against the project he has joined, especially when a mutinous group attempts to rebel and they try to get Michael to join them. But in the end, he chooses to stay with the Claw and Fasalina, with whom he ends up sharing a deep bond.\\n\\nMichael is one of the only member of The Original Seven along with Woo who is able to control an \"Original Armor\" without needing surgical implants embedded into his body. This is the main reason why the Claw chose him, and Michael later proves out to be a vital part of the Claw\\'s plan.\\n\\nHe pilots the Original Seven Armor Saudade of Sunday, which was launched into space and destroyed two of the Original Seven satellites. There, he encounters Van and the two of them battle, with Van constantly reminding Michael about Wendy. Whether this is a diversion tactic or Van genuinely cares very much about Wendy, it enrages Michael and he blames Van in turn for making Wendy leave Evergreen. Their fight is interrupted by an explosion brought about by the moon and the liquid-state material surrounding it, but continues when they return to the Planet of Endless Illusion, where Van also continues to scold and taunt Michael for not being a good brother. In the end, Michael is defeated and Saudade destroyed.\\n\\nIn the penultimate episode, he and Wendy meet again, and when he tells her to step aside as he still has to complete his mission, she points his own gun towards him, answering that he\\'s not the only one with a mission to complete. She ultimately shoots him in the arm when he keeps on going, using up the last bullet in the gun. Wendy begins to explain the negative effects of the Claw\\'s plan, which only makes Michael even angrier. He then tries to strangle her out of rage, but Wendy is saved by Kameo biting Michael\\'s hand. Even so, he still saves her from being crushed by falling debris, and the two siblings come to an understanding and part ways, with Michael leaving his gun with Wendy and advising her to follow her own path, while he follows his. He and his lover Fasalina seemingly perish after a boulder falls on top of them, though this is not confirmed.\\n\\nArmor: Saudade of Sunday resembles an energy handgun\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

His dragon is Chibi(Chibisuke in Japanese). Chibi gains a special sword in one of the episodes after he defeats a legendary dragon. Many conflicts happens in his journey and he gains many allies. \\n\\nManga Season 2:\\nStill as lazy as ever, he has hardly changed since his younger days.

Neji and Lee have somewhat of a rivalry, much like that of Guy and Kakashi Hatake. Lee is determined to prove that a \"failure\" such as himself can defeat a \"genius\" such as Neji. Neji, however, doesn\\'t seem to be interested in this goal of Lee\\'s, and Lee doesn\\'t seem to have made an effort to prove the point to Neji. Despite this apparent clashing of ideals between the two, Neji seems to get along fairly well with Tenten, with the latter often helping Neji with his training. Neji and Tenten also tend to share opinions on Lee and Guy\\'s overreactive behaviors, often wondering how they can train the way they do.\\n\\nAs a member of the Hyuga clan, Neji has a Byakugan, allowing him to see the chakra flow of others and block the flow upon contact with his Gentle Fist style. As a member of the clan\\'s branch house, Neji can never hope to be taught how to use the clan\\'s most secret techniques by the clan\\'s elders. Despite this, Neji has learned many of the clan\\'s strongest techniques independently, even creating a few unique skills of his own. Because of this, Neji is known as a genius ninja and graduated from the Academy as the #1 rookie.\\n\\nBecause his father, Hizashi Hyuga, was a member of a branch house of the Hyuga clan, Neji was born into the branch house. As a result, he was branded with the Hyuga branch family seal at a young age so that the members of the main house could keep him in check. Hizashi, believing Neji to be denied his potential as a branch house member, openly resented the main house, causing Neji to acquire the same feelings due to his father\\'s influence. In time, Neji\\'s hatred for the main house would increase exponentially as result of Hizashi being sacrificed to save the life of Hiashi Hyuga, Hizashi\\'s twin brother. Neji believed that his father was forced to die for his twin brother. Because of this, Neji came to feel that fate was something decided at birth and that no matter what one does, people cannot escape their destiny. This idea would go on to shape Neji\\'s life, creating a deep hatred for the main house and all of its members. \\n\\nAfter the Chunnin Exams when Neji fights Naruto his both his great skill and potential are recognized by the clan leader, his uncle Hiashi Hyuuga, and is sought out by him to train with the main branch of the family to further enhance Neji\\'s skills. This helps ease some of the tensions between the two branches of the Hyuuga clan.'}},\n",

Saki and Kurumi fight, with the latter being defeated easily due to Nakahito\\'s still-standing order to not fight. The victory is short-lived however, as Saki\\'s improper activation causes her to collapse. Kurumi kisses Saki, and her Mark II Heart reenergizes Saki\\'s Angel Heart. The action permanently activates Saki, and the master-servant relationship is reinstated, with Saki pledging her loyalty and love to Kurumi. Kurumi largely ignores this vow, but the two mutually call each other \"sister\" from then on. Later, Saki was kidnapped by Karinka, who brutally attacked and defeated her. It took Saki several weeks (and about 5 episodes) after Kurumi saved her to recover. Saki is very quiet, the antithesis of Kurumi, and is quite lady-like in comparison. She is the kindest, and maybe the sweetest character in the show. She entertains wild fantasies about herself and Kurumi, but never speaks about them or properly expresses her love. Saki wears a white maid\\'s outfit with black trim, and sleeps in a yukata similar to Kurumi\\'s. She enjoys taking baths, though mainly because it allows her to be naked with Kurumi.

Prior to the appearance of the men she was the ship\\'s only doctor. During the first season, she spent her free time trying to exploit the bad habits of the male crew members and would secretly keep tabs on the men and either jot down notes in her journal or take pictures with her camera, which she refers to as \"Pai-checks.\" This would soon pay off and sparked a raid that got all the men, including the drifter Rabat, locked up for a while. However, she stops this after a combination of seeing Dita\\'s reaction to Hibiki\\'s imprisonment and the discovery that men and women were of the same species, but she resumes her activities anyway. She carries a frog hand puppet with her all the time and is often seen talking to people with it in a gruff low pitched voice. She is usuaually either seen with Duelo or spying on everyone. At the end of season 2 she gave in the impulse and flicked Duelo\\'s hair up to see his face, and apparently thought him rather handsome..

He is already well-known as a brilliant young detective, the \"Savior of the police force,\" for solving many difficult cases that the professionals could not. However, while investigating two mysterious men, he is spotted and forced to swallow an experimental poison known as APTX 4869. This results in his body shrinking to that of a 6-year-old.\\n\\nShinichi comes up with the alias Conan Edogawa after Arthur Conan Doyle and Edogawa Rampo and pretends to be a distant relative of Agasa\\'s who places Conan in Ran\\'s care. Ran\\'s father Mouri Kogorou, owns a Detective Agency which Conan uses to his advantage to discover cases involving the Black Organization.\\n\\nAs Conan, Shinichi helps Ran\\'s father solve cases by putting him to sleep and simulating Kogorou\\'s voice using the special bowtie gadget Professor Agasa made for him. By solving cases one after the other, he helps build up Kogorou\\'s reputation who will later on be referred to as \"Sleeping Kogorou.\" He also spends a good amount of time with his Detective Boys fellows and solves many small cases with them and sometimes in the company of Professor Agasa.\\n\\nConan remains very close to Ran, who in return is very protective of him. However, because Ran is unaware of his true identity, Conan often finds himself in awkward situations with her, such as when she confessed her feeling for Shinichi to him and when she made him bathe with her at a hot spring.\\n\\nConan\\'s intelligence remains intact even though he has shrunken into a child. As Shinichi, his deductive ability earned him the monikers \"Heisei Holmes\" and \"Savior of the Japanese police force.\" Conan maintains an extraordinarily broad knowledge of many subjects and trivia that help him solve cases and escape tricky situations. Conan tries to speak in a child-like manner when dealing with adults, but he often gets caught up in the current case and begins speaking like an adult, referring to advanced topics and using reasoning much too complex for a normal child. When this happens, he often tries to pass it off as \"something [he] heard on TV\" or \"taught by uncle Kogoro/professor Agasa/Shinichi-niichan.\"\\n\\n\\nLikewise, he makes no effort to hide his love for Sherlock Holmes and soccer, so if he called out for talking about either subject in too much detail, he tries to escape suspicion by saying it was something Shinichi told him about. Although as the series has progressed the adults around him have become more used to his \"being quite smart for a child,\" causing him to behave more like himself around them, he still tries to pass as a normal child. The only police officers with whom Conan can speak in a professional manner are the FBI, especially Jodie Starling, Shuichi Akai, James Black, and Inspector Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Police, all of whom suspect that there is more to Conan than meets the eye.\\n\\nConan tends to act more like himself around the Detective Boys, even to the point that they find it odd when he acts like a child around adults. He will often play games like baseball with the Detective Boys, but he is too used to soccer to perform well and will even instinctively use soccer techniques, such as kicking in games that do not call for it. Because he is unfamiliar with popular games and TV shows, and bad at video games, Genta and the others tend to think of him as dumb. This annoys Conan so much that he will secretly watch TV in the living room after Kogoro and Ran go to sleep to get more \"practice\" in.\\n\\n(Source: Detectiveconanworld.com)'}},\n",

Eri is a lawyer who often gets tangled in Mouri\\'s cases, usually serving as an extra pair of eyes when it becomes time to investigate a crime. Although she does not like Mouri\\'s attitude and personality (especially his drinking and nanpa habits), she still deeply loves and cares for him, often testing him to see if he still cares about her as well.\\n\\nEri and Mouri, like Shinichi and Ran and Heiji and Kazuha, had been best friends since childhood, falling in love in their teens. Ten years before the Detective Conan storyline starts, however, Mouri and Eri separated and took different paths in their lives. After seperating, Eri focused full time on her duties as a lawyer and has since become a highly respected (and feared) member of her profession.\\n\\nEri is considered incredibly attractive. Various men of different ages have pined for her, but she always turns them down, mostly due to her feelings for Mouri. She and Yukiko were considered the two most beautiful girls at Teitan High School back when they were students. However, even though the result ended in a tie, the two remained very close friends, often letting little Shinichi and Ran play together and have playdates. Shinichi remembers often how Eri would give him a big scolding for starting trouble.\\n\\nEri\\'s personality suits her occupation as a lawyer. She is often very questioning, and gets herself involved in the investigation of cases along with Mouri, much to his chagrin. She has a cat, a Russian Blue named \"Goro,\" whom she cares for very deeply. Eri is also very close friends with her secretary, Kuriyama Midori.\\n\\nEri is highly intelligent and has a sharp eye for details, and is also a skilled judoka, taught by Mouri himself. She has proven on more than one occasion that she can lend a big helping hand in cases, and her deductions are almost always accurate. Ran often goes to Eri for advice, especially on Ran\\'s relationship with Shinichi. Eri has often half jokingly said that her best advice for Ran is to never get involved with a detective.\\n\\n(Source: Detective Conan Wiki)'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Mouri Kogorou is a private detective and Ran\\'s father. Some time ago, he worked in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Division One with Inspector Megure, but while an excellent marksman he was not a particularly good investigator. Around the time Mouri left the police force, his wife Kisaki Eri also moved out, though they have never officially divorced despite ten years having passed.\\n\\nMouri has an overinflated sense of his own importance and detective prowess to the point where he doesn\\'t investigate why he is suddenly and consistently passing out at crime scenes and solving cases in his sleep with different deductions than he was making while awake. He is also frequently unprofessional in his work, frequently making sarcastic and blunt comments about suspects or even his own clients. \\n\\nOn cases, Mouri is typically lax with his deductions and investigation, following only the most obvious clues or assumptions to reach his conclusions, which are often silly or fall directly into a culprit\\'s trap. The police, especially Megure, often find him to be an embarrassment while awake and hope to see \"Nemuri no Kogorou\"  (Sleeping Detective) as soon as possible. Mouri does have a serious side which only emerges when the case has personal importance to him, such as when Eri and Ran are involved. When this happens, Mouri\\'s entire personality and demeanor changes and he begins acting professionally, demonstrating improved deductive skills and cunning. While he is not up to the standards of Shinichi and he still can have problems with finding clues, his logical reasoning becomes better, and Mouri often demonstrates he has a better sense of interpersonal relationships than Shinichi does.\\n\\nMouri easily becomes infatuated with beautiful women. His favorite celebrity is pop idol Okino Yoko, and he never misses (or tries not to miss) her television shows. He also keeps a large collection of Yoko related goods and his office and bedroom have Yoko posters. Because of his flirtatious behavior around attractive women, he often embarrasses Ran, and while it is not stated as the reason why Eri left him, it is one of the primary reasons why she hasn\\'t come back.\\n\\nWhile never outright called an alcoholic, Mouri has a tendency to get intoxicated and Shinichi/Conan often makes sarcastic remarks about him spending money on alcohol. In the anime, particularly in early episodes, his office is littered with empty beer cans, and he keeps a well-stocked liquor shelf. Mouri is also a heavy smoker, and is usually seen with a cigarette in his mouth. Other hobbies include watching his favorite idol star, Okino Yoko, betting on horse races, playing mahjong (which he tends to lose) and playing or watching baseball (he even plays in his neighborhood\\'s team). \\n\\nIn the movies, Mouri suffers from a mild acrophobia (fear of heights) and is quite uncomfortable in high settings where he has the chance to see how high up he is. He does not have this fear in the manga.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Mouri Ran is a childhood friend of Kudou Shinichi. She is the daughter of Mouri Kogorou, a private detective, and Kisaki Eri, a lawyer. Her parents got separated when she was seven, and one of her biggest goals is to get them back together. Her best friend next to Shinichi is her classmate Suzuki Sonoko, who constantly teases her about her relationship with Shinichi.\\n\\nAfter Shinichi\\'s disappearance, Ran met Edogawa Conan, who was introduced by Professor Agasa as a \"distant relative\" and asked Ran if she wouldn\\'t mind taking care of him at her house. She and her father practically adopted him; Ran immediately came to think of him as a surrogate little brother. Little did (and still does) Ran know that \"Conan\" is actually Shinichi.\\n\\nRan\\'s greatest personality trait is that she genuinely cares for those she loves. She is also patient, kind, and nurturing. Like Shinichi, she highly values justice to the point of idealism. To avoid making Shinichi choose between her and his important case (really an excuse because Shinichi has turned into Conan and can\\'t return), she has decided to wait for him to finish it, trusting his promise that he will come back despite their separation causing Ran a lot of emotional pain. Ran is also very hot-blooded and tends to act on impulses when the people she cares about are involved; the combination of jumping to conclusions and not hesitating to use karate on those who she perceives to have wronged someone have led to several \"near-miss\" misunderstandings. Early on, she would become violently suspicious if she thought Shinichi was philandering although more recently his confessions have lead her to trust his intentions. Even though Ran is in love with Shinichi, she often fails to convey her feelings because she suddenly becomes self conscious.\\n\\nShe can be very brave and resourceful when she wants to be, and rescues Conan from trouble on occasion. However, she has an irrational fear of the supernatural and is thus—unlike her friend Sonoko—absolutely no fan of anything related to the horror genre. She also constantly tries to reunite her father and mother again - though with little success, thanks to the mutual stubbornness of both parents. Men also tend to pay her a lot of undue romantic attention, a fact that makes Sonoko somewhat jealous (and of which Ran herself is completely unaware).\\n\\nRan is very self sufficient for her age. This is because her father is drunk, slovenly, and fiscally irresponsible. She handles many of the Mouri household\\'s financial affairs and all the cooking and housework. She also ensures Kogorou doesn\\'t slack off on his job, is on his best behavior for client meetings, and she often greets and provides refreshments for potential clients.'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Loki\\'s second son takes the form of a polite, bespectacled boy in his late teens, and serves as his housekeeper, cook, and assistant. He enjoys cooking, cleaning and other domestic activities, and in the anime, he also has an amusing addiction to ordering useless items from mail-order catalogs. His real name is Jormungand, also known as the Midgard serpent, since his true form is that of a giant serpent that encircles the Earth. Loki rescued Yamino from the bottom of the sea by casting a spell on him (thus giving him a human form) so that he could accompany his father on Earth; for this, he is eternally grateful. The revelation of Yamino\\'s true identity occurs earlier in the manga than the anime, and seems to play more of a part in his characterization for the first manga series. He probably wears glasses as a reference to the Indian cobra (眼鏡蛇 meganehebi, or \"glasses snake\", in Japanese). (Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

However, in the course of his plans, Frey runs into Mayura, falls in love at first sight, and renames her Yamato Nadeshiko (大和撫子, a name for the prototypical ideal woman; a sort of Japanese Dulcinea), and in the English anime, his \"Classic Japanese Beauty.\"'}},\n",

Occasionally, she seems to take delight in acts of low-level destruction, such as chopping off flowers or destroying anything that Ai cares for. She has shown incredible skills with her loincloth, using to catch or hit objects. Despite the fact she appears to wreak havoc on her, she takes orders from Ai and Ai alone (in one episode, she shows this while going to touch Ai's grandmother's spinning wheels despite the woman's protests).\"}},\n",

With the surviving soldiers recognizing him as a Celestial Warrior, Nakago is brought to the Emperor where his natural beauty results in his being sexually abused by the Emperor. As he mastered complete control over his abilities, he eventually became a seemingly loyal soldier of Kuto, with the Emperor unaware that Nakago has been planning to betray him all his life. \\n\\n\\nYu Watase notes on several occasions in the chapter notes, as well in the second installment of the omake \"The Tale of the Forbidden Women\\'s Hot Spring\" from the series 1 OVA (as stated by Nakago himself), that Nakago is her favourite character.'}},\n",

He was outspoken and bore a rough disposition, but his down-to-earth attitude was one of the reasons why everyone looked up to him. Kaien treated his fellow company members indiscriminately, regardless of their social standing or rank. Because of this, he was popular among aristocrats and commoners alike within his Division.\\n\\nHe was the first person in Seireitei to treat Rukia like an ordinary person since her adoption into the Kuchiki family. Until he came along, she was treated with careful respect to her face and talked about and bashed behind her back. She was grateful for the fact that Kaien treated her as an equal, and it has been hinted that Rukia may have come to develop romantic feelings for him because of this. She didn’t pursue him because Kaien was already married to the third seat of the 13th Division, Miyako Shiba.\\n\\nKaien believed that one\\'s \"heart\" was determined based on the prospects of fighting and protecting. He was a firm believer in Captain Ukitake\\'s policy on fighting, which consists of two types of combat: 1) The fight to protect life, and 2) The fight to protect honor. Kaien took it a step further and believed they both end up being the same thing: \"Heart.\" He believed that every time one connected with another, a little bit of \"heart\" is born between them. He thought of \"heart\" as not something inside you, but rather what is born whenever you think of, or remember, someone else. He believed that one\\'s \"heart\" exists in others, and that it remains with his or her comrades even after death. Having held such views, he believed that people should never die alone.\\n\\nKaien\\'s favorite food was ohagi, and he liked to take afternoon naps if he could.'}},\n",

       "   'about': \"Keita is the male lead of the show. He was considered a failure by his family due to his attitude towards their ancient duty to vanquish evil, treating it like a parttime job, and his initial inability to find an Inukami to bond with. Even though Yôko becomes his inukami and is fully interested in him, he has a bad habit of flirting with other girls; it is later revealed that Keita is mortified by the thought that, if he should develop a relationship with Yôko, he might become the father of a litter of puppies, rather than of a human baby. He is frequently punished for his transgressions by Yôko, to whom he had to promise that he would be loyal to her, that he would be hers and that he would be her toy, to do with whatever she wanted, before she would contract with him. He wears a dog's collar as a symbol of this pact - an item he originally intended as his 'vow gift' to Yôko. Yôko has frequently landed him in jail by teleporting him into a public place without his clothes, causing him to be mistaken for a streaker and arrested for indecent exposure. Due to this, he has been named Ra-ou (Naked King) by the city's perverts (male and female alike). \\n\\nKeita possesses considerable athletic skills, can make frog-shaped talismans up to around the size of his fist from rubber which he can use to make ranged attacks and is a practitioner of xingyiquan. However, a shinigami named 'Sea of Violence' commented his martial arts skill lack style. Despite his many flaws, Keita has considerable redeeming qualities; he is determined, usually fearless and loyal to his friends and to people under his protection.\"}},\n",

The name \"Sai\" is given to him for the purposes of joining the team, his actual name being unknown. He was recruited at a young age by Root, which trained him to have no emotions so as to make it easier for him to accomplish missions. This lack of personality causes Sai to meet with hardship upon joining Team 7, as he makes the mistake of insulting the other members in an attempt to seem sociable. He tries to seem more caring by smiling, though his teammates come to dislike it due to his obvious insincerity. After spending more time with his team Sai comes to appreciate bonds, particularly the bond that exists between Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha. Wanting to experience bonds for himself, Sai sets out to make as many bonds as he can. His initial attempts consist of giving people pet names, though his habit of calling people as he sees them (\"fat\", \"ugly\", etc.) finds little success. Realizing that people dislike hearing how they actually look, Sai begins to say the opposite of how he sees them, such as calling Ino Yamanaka \"beautiful\". With names proving successful, Sai has since made attempts to be helpful to others, though his attempts have thus far been unwanted by those he is trying to help.\\n\\nSai is a talented artist, and claims to have drawn thousands of pictures. Despite the magnitude of pictures he has drawn, his lack of emotion makes it impossible for him be inspired to give something a title, and thus all of his works are nameless. Sai\\'s drawing ability is also the source of his jutsu; by drawing things with a brush on his scroll he is able to bring his creations to life, giving them an increased size and the ability to move. His Super Beasts Imitation Picture (超獣偽画, Chōjū Giga) allows him to create birds that he can use for flight and lion-like creatures that he can use for attack. Likewise, by creating an Ink Clone (墨分身, Sumi Bunshin?) of himself, he can perform a reconnaissance of an area without actually endangering himself. Sai can also transform words he writes on his scroll into small animals that seek out their target and revert back to words upon arriving, giving Sai an easy way to communicate.'}},\n",

Suigetsu once trained to be one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, and as such has a number of traits consistent with other known members. In addition to having shark-like teeth, Suigetsu enjoys killing; Kisame Hoshigaki, one of the Seven Swordsmen, claims Suigetsu is a prodigy at the art of murder, as he has a habit of chopping off his victim's limbs before beheading them. He is also very confident in his abilities, since he has threatened Sasuke Uchiha on more than one occasion. Not afraid to speak his mind and always doing as he pleases, Suigetsu clashed with Sasuke at first, but eventually came to accept Sasuke's position and even put himself in harm's way to protect him.\\n\\nAfter joining Hebi, Sasuke takes Suigetsu to retrieve Zabuza Momochi's giant Kubikiri Hōchō from his graveside. Suigetsu can wield the weapon with relative ease, despite its enormous size and weight. In his allegiance with Sasuke, Suigetsu hopes to acquire the sword of Kisame as well, which Karin assumes to mean that he wants to collect all of the swords of the Seven Swordsmen.\\n\\nSuigetsu is able to reduce himself to liquid form and return to bodily form at will. This ability also allows him to change his body shape, giving him the ability to increase the size of his limbs, proportionally increasing his strength, if necessary. It also makes striking him somewhat difficult; since he is made of liquid, any sufficiently powerful strike will go right through his watery form. Suigetsu is the first ninja seen carrying water bottles on his outfit. Given his somewhat frequent desire to consume water, it is suggested that Suigetsu requires regular hydration to sustain his watery form.\"}},\n",

She installs bugs in the Yotsuba Group\\'s meeting room to secretly observe the group\\'s weekly meetings. She does the same for Higuchi\\'s car, allowing the team to watch his desperate attempts to kill Matsuda. Since she is a professional criminal, she is known solely in the underworld.\\n\\nWedy uses her initial in computer communication; to avoid confusion with Watari (\"W\"), she deliberately uses the lowercase form, \"w\".\\n\\nShe (like Aiber) is referenced to, but does not appear in, Death Note: Another Note.\\n\\nOhba said that he created Aiber and Wedy so he could use characters with \"special abilities\" to advance the storyline. He said that he wanted to use Wedy more than Aiber. As an example he explained a scenario involving Light controlling Wedy, making her place cameras in the headquarters so Misa could see L\\'s face \"... or something.\"\\n\\nAccording to Obata, he drew Wedy as a female model as he did not know what kind of character she would be. Obata added that Wedy has the \"stereotypical female spy look.\" Obata believes that if he drew Aiber and Wedy to look \"a little bit more original\", Ohba could have included the characters in a larger role in Death Note.'}},\n",

However, his world is turned upside down when he discovers that he is already dead and does not have much time before he disappears. Fortunately, Yuuji is a Mystes who contains a treasure known as the \"Reiji Maigo\" (零時迷子, Midnight Lost Child). The treasure inside him restores his Power of Existence every night at midnight. With the Reiji Maigo, Yuuji has the possibility to live on like an average human as long as he makes sure that his Power of Existence does not run out before midnight. Later, he begins to learn to use the yet untapped potential of the treasure kept within him. He cares deeply about Shana, but does not make any advances in their relationship due to his feelings of depreciation as a Torch and viewing Shana as someone who is beyond his reach. He also starts to see Shana from her old former perspective of the world, where he is just a Torch and she is just a Flame Haze. With this going on, he distanced himself from the closeness that the two originally shared previously.\\n\\nYuuji is kind person who puts others before himself. This often draws much confusion and annoyance from Shana, as prior torches from Shana\\'s experience exhibited selfish attitudes. However, Yuuji\\'s compassion and empathy sow the seeds of attraction between him and Shana. He accepts his fate with no ill feelings, a trait which surprised the Flame-Haired Burning-Eyed Hunter, knowing that most Torches would be depressed to the point that they would even commit suicide before their existence wears off. In fact, Yuuji uses this fate to commit acts of heroism, defended by the belief that even if his existence would one day disappear, his sacrifice would be proof that he had once lived.\\n\\nDespite all these changes, he still struggles to live the ordinary life he once had and at the same time, trying to help Shana in her battles and save Misaki City and its inhabitants.'}},\n",

He is a \\'bishounen,\\' which means a pretty or beautiful boy. He is very feminine looking, with a beautiful face and shoulder-length and long eyelashes. His appearance is so influential, that several dying people in the hospital have a miraculous recovery after laying eyes on him. Wolfram possesses fire magic, as well as being adept with a sword. He is the half-brother of Conrad and Gwendal. He has extremely high pride and is hot-headed. He is arrogant and short-tempered but can also be quite compassionate at times. He is called \"little lord brat.\" He is the only one of the previous queen\\'s three sons who inherited her emerald green eyes and blonde hair, bearing a striking resemblance to her. It seems he inherited fire magic and selfishness from his fathers side. Wolfram is obsessed with Yuuri and insists on following him everywhere as he claims it is his duty to protect his fiancé, though he also seems to want to prevent him from cheating on him. His ancestor, Rufus Bielefield, fought alongside the Original King (the great one).\\n\\nNear the end of the second season, there is a time when Wolfram is possessed by Original King, who in turned was possessed by Soushu. The key he possesses, his heart, is ripped out by Original King in order to open one of the four boxes, \\'Hellfire in Frozen Land\\' (\\'Hellfire on Frozen Tundra\\' in Japanese translation). Because of this, Wolfram temporarily dies, but is revived when the Original King returns the keys to their owners.\\n\\nWolfram is the youngest son of the former Maou, Cecilie von Spitzweig. He initially dislikes humans, even Conrad\\'s father. Because of his mazoku pride, he does not like to admit that Conrad is his brother, even though he cares for Conrad (Wolfram always referred to Conrad by his last name—Lord Weller; however, after Conrad\\'s return from his supposed betrayal, Wolfram refers to Conrad by his first name). In the graphic novels, it is hinted that this hatred towards humans stems from his late father\\'s prejudice against humans. His liking for humans improves throughout the series, progressing to the point that he adopts the human girl Greta as his daughter, starts acknowledging Yuuri\\'s parents as his future \"in-laws\" and also runs into a raging fire to save a human child.\\n\\nYears ago when he was a child, Wolfram accidentally slapped Elizabeth, Raven\\'s niece, on her left cheek. Elizabeth never forgot this incident, insisting that they swore everlasting love that day, while Wolfram insists he forgot why he slapped her in the first place. Some time after collecting three of the Four Forbidden Boxes, Elizabeth becomes Stoffel\\'s tool to separate Yuuri from the three brothers, pronouncing an engagement proposal to Yuuri. Elizabeth\\'s real goal is to marry Wolfram Onii-sama, but Wolfram says that his only fiance is Yuuri. During the duel which ensues, (as Yuuri accidentally picked up a knife and a fork pointing it at Elizabeth; symbolizing a fight to settle a triangle love affair), Yuuri turns into the Maou, protecting Wolfram from being hurt by fire maryoku that Elizabeth summoned. He proclaims the two go on the date and remember their childhood memories. It is eventually learned that Wolfram slapped Elizabeth because he wanted to touch a butterfly that flew past, and Conrad was watching the entire event.\\n\\nWolfram is an extremely \\'pretty\\' person—Yuuri calls him this upon first meeting him (specifically using the term \\'bishōnen\\' in the Japanese version and very often in the light novel). This is also why Yuuri slapped Wolfram when he badmouthed Yuuri\\'s mother instead of punching him, stating that it\\'s a pity to dirty such a pretty face (Source: the novels). This image is enhanced by his choice of nightwear—a frilly pink nightgown that contrasts violently with his rather quick temper.\\n\\nWhen he first becomes engaged to Yuuri he is extremely upset, but the idea quickly grows on him. He takes the engagement much more seriously than Yuuri does. He follows Yuuri practically everywhere so he can keep an eye on him and even sneaks into Yuuri\\'s bedroom at night. He gets extremely jealous when Yuuri talks to a girl or good-looking guy and often accuses him of being unfaithful which is sometimes used as comic relief, but as a character he is popular between fans and is considered to be the anime\\'s breakout character. Even if he does not like to admit it, the series hints that Wolfram deeply cares about Yuuri. He tends to think Yuuri can be saved from bad situations because of his cuteness. By the end of the anime, he is making blatant declarations of love.\\n\\nA major weakness is that he gets sea-sick. Yuuri also says that Wolfram cannot paint well, even though he insists on painting. For example, he tries to paint Yuuri, although it turns out unintentionally impressionistic.\\n\\nDuring the end of season two and the beginning of season three, Wolfram is chosen by the Ten Noble Families of Shin Makoku (Christ, Voltaire, Grantz, Bielefeld, Karbelnikoff, Wincott, Spitzberg, Gyllenhaal, Rochefort, and Radford) to become the next Maou, due to the belief that Yuuri would not be able to return to Shin Makoku at the time. When Yuuri does in fact return, Wolfram\\'s uncle, Waltorana, places pressure on Wolfram to obtain the throne. Because of this, Wolfram dissolves the engagement with Yuuri and travels back to his homelands, in hopes that he would not be used to sabotage Yuuri.\\n\\nDiscovering of Wolfram\\'s predicament, Yuuri and his retainers travel to the Bielefeld lands in the hopes of persuading Wolfram to return to Blood Pledge Castle, only to be forced into a formal duel by Wolfram himself. The battle becomes quite intense, as Wolfram gives his all against Yuuri and Yuuri trying his best to persuade Wolfram to stop the duel. At the climax, Yuuri was forced to protect himself by becoming the Maou and, angered by Wolfram\\'s reckless dueling, prepares to hit Wolfram with a potentially fatal attack. In the process of hitting Wolfram with the attack, Yuuri watched as Wolfram prepared himself for what seems to be his last moment and gave his final words to Yuuri: \"Yuuri. Be a good king.\" Realizing that Wolfram had planned the whole thing from the beginning so Yuuri could remain the Maou, Yuuri absorbed the attack onto himself at the last moment, sparring Wolfram of the damage. The Ten Noble Families then changed their decision to keep Yuuri as their king and Waltorana steps down from forcing Wolfram onto the throne. After a reconciliation between the two, Wolfram happily decides to annul the disengagement to a comically shocked Yuuri and proceeds to return to his normal attitude towards their engagement.\\n\\nDuring the course of the series, Wolfram has grown exponentially from a spoiled prince to a selfless young man who stands by Yuuri with no question. Though, he had no plans of becoming Maou in the first place, he was willing to protect and serve Shin Makoku when it was resolved that Yuuri would not be returning back at the end of the second season, wanting to protect the beautiful job Yuuri did as Maou.\\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

Günter is a skilled swordsman and magician but has retired to teach Yuuri about Shin Makoku and his future duties as the Maou. Günter once stated that he was the one who taught Conrad to \"become His Majesty\\'s sword and shield\" indicating that perhaps Günter was once Conrad\\'s teacher. When Günter accidentally travels to Earth, he becomes a model in New York City for a brief period of time so that he can earn money to find Yuuri.

       "   'about': \"He is generally shown as to be calm and open minded. In fact, many comparatives can be made between his personality and Yin and Yang, which he appropriately wears the symbol of, the Taijitu. The forces of Yin and Yang are generally described as opposite but complementary forces, and the same can be said about him. He can be calm and collected, but also a fierce competitor. These two qualities can be referred to as opposites, but they are not absolute in their differences, and the same can be said about Yin and Yang. Furthermore, the forces of Yin and Yang are interdependent, meaning that they cannot exist without their counterpart. This can also be compared to Ray's personality. His whole nature seems to be similar in principal to this metaphysical concept.\\n\\n(Season One) Ray is first introduced to the show in episode 6, named Dragoon Storm. In this episode, he is portrayed as a powerful and confident competitor. However, some may say that he is shown as overconfident in some aspects, especially before the battle against Tyson had even begun. In the first battle, Ray easily, and almost effortlessly destroys Tyson's blade using his bit beast Driger's Tiger Claw attack. The following battle, Ray becomes somewhat cocky about his ability, and ends up losing the 2nd round to Tyson. Ray forfeits the final, deciding battle, saying that he had no more to prove. After the final round of the Tournament, between Tyson and Kai, Ray approaches Tyson, along with Max and Mr. Dickenson, inviting him and Kai to join the new BBA team called the Blade Breakers.\\n\\nThroughout the first season, Ray is looked to for advice about battles. He is generally revered as a kind hearted, polite individual, who is very welcoming when meeting new people. He is also shown as being very open minded, especially about Beyblading techniques. This is emphasised in the Asian tournament, used as a means to justify his leaving of his home village. It is also shown in this season that he has an uncle who is the head chef at a restaurant in Paris, which is owned by Olivers' Dad. It is also shown that he works as a waiter in a restaurant in Hong Kong for extra cash. This has led to an opinion of him loving to cook.\\n\\n(Season Two) Generally, Ray is shown in a similar light as to how he is portrayed in season 1, although in V-Force, he is much more critical of his performance.\\n\\nA good example of Ray's kind hearted nature is shown in V-Force, in the battle against Salima and Cyber Driger. During this battle, Salima becomes somewhat hypocritical towards her original philosophies towards beyblading. Because of this, Ray spends most of the battle trying to convince her that using Cyber Driger has tainted her beliefs.\\n\\nRay uses three beyblades in the second season--Driger Fang, Driger Vulcan, and Driger Vulcan 2.\\n\\n(Season Three) In this series, Ray is portrayed in a very different way from the other two series. In the previous two, he was shown as being a polite young man, but unconfident in his beyblading ability. In G-Revolution however, he is shown as being confident, almost to the point of being cocky. It is this that causes him to lose some of his matches. During this series, he leaves the Bladebreakers to help form the White Tigers X team, partnering up with his former teammate, Lee.\\n\\nRay uses three beyblades in this season, the Driger Vulcan 2,the Driger Gatling, and Driger Metal Slash. \\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)\"}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Age: 12 (I); 15 (II)\\nBirthday: September 22\\nHoroscope: Virgo\\nBlood Type: AB\\nHeight: 170 cm\\nWeight: 53.4 kg\\nRank: Genin (I); Chuunin (II)\\nLikes: taking naps, playing shogi\\nDislikes: Hard-boiled eggs\\n\\nShikamaru is an extremely unenthusiastic person, and as such lives his life avoiding work. This is partly due to him seeking paths of least resistance, as he often chooses to do things he would otherwise not do if people nag him enough. In his free time he typically takes naps, watches clouds, and plays strategy games such as Shogi and Go. When put into a situation where he potentially needs to put effort into something, he attempts to try to find a way to avoid it such as forfeiting a battle or by pretending to be preoccupied with something else. In the instances where he can not avoid these situations, Shikamaru tends to remark \"how troublesome.\"\\n\\nDespite his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent. His teacher, Asuma, found Shikamaru to have an IQ of over 200, and learned that Shikamaru\\'s poor grades were a result of him finding lifting a pencil to be too much work for him. Nevertheless, Shikamaru works very well with his teammates, as their fathers were teamed together in their youth. Of his teammates, Shikamaru is closest with Chouji, who repays Shikamaru\\'s confidence in him with unyielding loyalty. Shikamaru also has a strong bond with Asuma, often spending time with him playing strategy games. After Asuma\\'s death, he even vows to protect Asuma and Kurenai\\'s unborn child for his teacher\\'s sake. Shikamaru has stated that he will make the child his apprentice someday.\\n\\nOne of Shikamaru\\'s more distinctive characteristics is that he finds all women to be bossy and \"a pain.\" Contrary to this opinion, he has expressed a notably mature interest in marriage and raising a family with a son and daughter. Ironically, Shikamaru seems to constantly find himself surrounded by the very same strong-willed and bossy women he dislikes. In addition to his own mother, and being surrounded by bossy females, he usually ends up fighting against such women. Shikamaru has had a number of his appearances coincide with those of Temari. When they make their Part II debut together, Naruto Uzumaki asks if they are on a date, though both Shikamaru and Temari state that this is not the case.\\n\\nWhen the need arises, Shikamaru is quick to abandon his lazy nature and act appropriately to complete a mission or save his teammates. Using his Shadow Imitation Technique, the signature technique of his clan, he can capture the shadow of an opponent to either keep them immobilized or force them to mimic his movements. This ability causes Shikamaru to frequently take the task of stalling enemies so that his comrades can get to safety or to simply buy time. Although this role puts him in a dangerous position once he can no longer stall the opponent, Shikamaru is willing to serve it, feeling that sacrificing his life to ensure the safety of his friends is worth it. He then considers every element that is relevant to the situation at hand and analyzes the information to its fullest, planning out a battle ten moves in advance and devising over a hundred strategies to use against an opponent. This combination of intelligence and dedication to his teammates causes Shikamaru to become the first of the primary Konoha Genin to advance to the rank of Chunin.\\n\\nOnce becoming a Chunin, Shikamaru\\'s father teaches him how to use his shadow technique more effectively, by using it to choke an opponent. This more interactive capability with his shadow is put to great use over the timeskip, and by Part II Shikamaru becomes proficient at using multiple shadow-based techniques at once. He is also able to manipulate his shadow to lift from the ground and either grab or throw weapons simply by utilizing an opponent\\'s shadow for the same purpose. After he comes into the possession of Asuma\\'s brass knuckles, Shikamaru learns to channel his shadow into them, using them to immobilize opponents by throwing them at an opponent\\'s shadow to capture them and save himself the energy.'}},\n",

She acted like a mentor, being tougher and more confident. Under her influence, Sakura began to develope her own identity. Though close to Ino, Sakura could not help but feel she was in her shadow and upon learning they liked the same boy, ended their friendship so that they could compete for his affection, beginning a bitter rivalry. Ino shed her tomboyish look in retaliation and was more open about her feelings towards Sasuke. The rivalry stays till the Chunin Exam. Nevertheless, they have a competitive relationship. She became somewhat superficial, thinking highly of her looks and has no problem telling people what she thinks, no matter how hurtful, such as telling Choji that he should focus more on his appearance because girls dislike overweight boys. On the surface of things, both of her teammates fit the profiles of people she wouldn\\'t associate with because of her apparent shallowness, but she actually cares deeply for their well-beings and maintains a strong bond with them. It should be noted that while Ino is portrayed as shallow she came to Sakura\\'s aid in the Forest of Death despite their feud. She cares very much about her friends, showing deep loyalty.\\n\\nAs a member of the Yamanaka clan, Ino works in her family\\'s flower shop and has become particularly talented in ikebana. She has been noted to be sharp upon occasion, such as noticing Asuma\\'s affection for Kurenai or using chakra cleverly. The anime\\'s filler arcs show that she\\'s been able to find other uses for her time in the shop and can tell a person\\'s profession by simply glancing at the condition of their hands. Being a Yamanaka has also shaped the mind-altering jutsu she uses. With the Mind Body Switch Technique, Ino can transfer to another\\'s body and use it for a time. The anime explains her medical abilities. During the final filler arc, Ino finds herself of no use to her teammates and becomes awed of Sakura\\'s skills. As such, Ino becomes Tsunade\\'s second apprentice, hoping to be more useful to her friends. The anime has also shown that Ino has developed her own inner-self named \"Inner Ino\". She, along with team 10 plus Kakashi, aids in the dispersion of two of Akatsuki\\'s members.'}},\n",

During his period with Section 2, Raballo spent a great deal of time with Claes outside the SWA, showing her a normal life, especially fishing. He also taught Claes the value of patience and encouraged her prior love of reading. Ultimately, however, he was unable to deal with what had been done to the girls of the SWA and of what was expected of him and Claes as a fratello, so Raballo left. Due to the strong bond developed between a girl and her handler, this act made Claes useless as an assassin, since it was effectively impossible to assign a new handler once a fratello have bonded.\"}},\n",

He seems to have some hidden feelings for the demon queen, that are far deeper than what most people suspect. Though most people consider Aion as a hopelessly cruel villian, he is in reality a very noble person underneath, whose tragic past has turned him into somebody obsessed with achieving his greatest dream, not caring about the means nor the consequences.

Over time, those with \"Advanced Blood\" came to be hated and feared. This forced those with advanced bloods into hiding in order to live in peace. Haku was one of the few people in the Mist with Advanced Blood left.\\n\\nWhen Haku was just a young child, his father discovered that his wife was part of an Advanced Bloodline. Haku\\'s father proceeded to kill his mother and then went after him. In Haku\\'s fright, he killed his father and fled his small village, believing himself to be a monster: a monster loved by no one.\\n\\nOn one faithful day, Haku looked up in the slums of the back alley to see a Shinobi staring down at him, this Shinobi was Zabuza. Haku then proclaimed, \"You have the same eyes as me\". Zabuza realized that Haku was one of the Advanced Bloodline limit carriers, and took the child under his wing. Haku was raised by Zabuza as \"a tool\" to be called upon when needed in exchange for his \"freedom\" from the slums. He learned how to use his unique abilities and eventually became a Hunter-Nin. When Zabuza\\'s plan to kill Mizukage fails, Haku fled the village along with Zabuza to fulfill his job as a veritable \"a tool.\"\\n\\nHaku\\'s slender frame and delicate appearance enables him to disguise himself in various ways. In fact, while finding medicine to treat Zabuza\\'s wounds Haku runs into Naruto. Naruto mistakenly believes Haku is a girl. As we see in the ensuing brawls, it is not appearance that determines strength. Rather, under that soft face we see that Haku has an adroit knack for speed and Jutsu skill. Combined with his knowledge of the human body, Haku can target his opponent\\'s vital organs and kill them instantly using pinpoint accuracy. The main choice to attack these vital organs is with simple needles that are used by physicians in the battle field.\\n\\nHaku\\'s bloodline originates in the country of Mist so it is no surprise that his Jutsus are water based. His \"Flying Water Needles\" is a technique whence he uses his chakra to create ice needles via water on the ground. Furthermore, he uses his chakra to control the path of the needles and strike the enemy. His other technique, \"Demonic Ice Mirrors\" uses water to create ice mirrors to surround the enemy. He then combines himself with the mirrors and uses the reflection to transport himself from mirror to mirror while attacking his enemy from all angles. His most incredible ability however, is the ability to do one-handed seals. This allows him to complete various tasks that are not capable of being accomplished without having a free hand.\\n\\nAlthough Haku is an exceptional fighter, he is a kind ninja who is saddened by unnecessary death. His fighting spirit comes from the will to protect his most \"precious person,\" because \"when a person has something precious to protect, that is when they can become truly strong.\"'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'An ambitious, sly, snarky person who wishes to become Montague\\'s heir. He is contemptuous of the common people and is charged by Montague to spy on Romeo. He also seems to have some degree of interest in Hermione, but whether he has honest feelings for her or desires to use her as a pawn in his possible plans remains debatable. Mercutio\\'s desire for power appears to stem from his resentment towards his father, Titus, who doesn\\'t live up to his son\\'s expectations as a Montague advisor. Montague is aware of his disdain for his father and encourages - none too subtlety - Mercutio to kill Titus, but he doesn\\'t do it.\\n\\n    A few days after Romeo\\'s banishment, Mercutio agrees to be adopted as Montague\\'s new heir but is unprepared for the bloody initiation, whose climax was Titus\\' death at the hands of Montague. Paralyzed by fear, Mercutio could not voice out for help nor assist his father\\'s peril, and later swore his loyalty to the bloodied Montague. He tries to fit the mold of Montague\\'s heir but, in truth, the event of his father\\'s death has traumatized him and his guilt over doing nothing envelopes him. The obvious collapse of Montague\\'s reign drives him to do what he thinks will get him the most praise: he stabs Montague and \"saves\" Juliet. Expecting to be called a hero, he is stricken when Tybalt dismisses him and leaves from the scene in mad laughter. \\n\\n(Souce: Wikipedia)'}},\n",

Bravo remained conscious and controlled Silver Skin to prevent both Hiwatari and Kazuki from harming each other until Showusei appeared and stopped both raging warriors. True to his name, the captain has a tendency to say \"Bravo\" when applauding someone.

Namu is only able to defeat her by closing his eyes and attacking her without, \"looking upon her womanly flesh.\" In the manga, her picture is briefly seen on one of the image rosters as one of the many targets of Tambourine\\'s mission to kill the martial artists in the King Piccolo Saga, though it is unknown if Ran Fuan was slain; given that she had not appeared in the manga or the anime after the Budoukai, it is safe to say that Tambourine was stopped before he could kill her. In the U.S. dub, the stripping was excluded. Instead, the scene of one of Namu\\'s failed attacks is shown followed by her twitching foot to show she was knocked out. This is strangely not edited in recaps, which clearly show her in her underwear. The words Ran &amp; Fuan are Japanese for \"Lingerie &amp; Foundation garments\".'}},\n",

       "   'about': 'Namu first appears in the 21st Tenka-ichi Budōkai, fighting Ran Fuan. He has problems fighting her, because he is a Buddhist monk and she strips to her underwear, socks &amp; shoes, but he overcomes and defeats her. His next fight is against Son Goku, and while it is an intense fight, he loses in the end. He competed because he needed the money to buy lots of water; where he was from, there was a terrible drought, and he had been sent to find a solution. Being defeated, however, he is unable to get the money to buy water and decides to leave. Muten Roshi reads his mind and gets acquainted with his intentions. He then gives him a capsule so that he can store water from a well, and in return, asks Namu to impersonate Muten Roshi in the crowd, as to protect Roshi\\'s secret identity from his students, who were suspicious of Chun being Muten Roshi. In the 22nd Tenka\\'chi Bud�kai, he also makes an appearance in one of its anime filler, claiming to Goku and Roshi that this time he came to enjoy it, but he ends up losing to Tenshinhan on the preliminary rounds, as he was left unconscious and nearly killed as Tenshinhan wanted to leave a message to Goku and his friends. Later, he is killed by Piccolo Daimaō\\'s minion, Tambourine. He is then revived by Shenlong. He is seen later in the DBZ series contributing to Goku\\'s spirited bomb, and has a brief appearance in GT in the episode titled Piccolo\\'s Decision. There are some rumors indicating that he might be related to Uub, but there is no confirmation. His name comes from the Nenbutsu: \"Namu Amida Butsu\".'}},\n",
